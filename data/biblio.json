		"abstract": "The sonification of human movement data is a new approach to support motor perception, motor control and learning in sports and rehabilitation. Perceptual and motor control mechanisms both benefit of additional acoustic information, both are performing more accurate compared to unimodal conditions. But how does movement sonification work when supporting perception and action - especially when processing together with visual information? What kind of perceptual mechanisms are addressed by movement vision and which are activated by additional movement acoustics? While visual motion perception is attended with reference to the approach of 'biological motion perception' in this paper, audio-visual phenomena are treated on the basis of 'multisensory integration'-research. Multisensory integration-research on speech perception as well as on basic perceptual phenomena had identified audiovisual integration sites in the CNS. The activation of multisensory integrationareas correlates with enhanced perceptual as well as behavioral performance. Here we proof this correlation for the sonification of human movement pattern with a first fMRI-study. Data support behavioral effects of movement sonification on perception and action in a first step.",

		"abstract": "Full-body human movement is characterized by fine-grain expressive qualities that humans are easily capable of exhibiting and recognizing in others’ movement. In sports (e.g., martial arts) and performing arts (e.g., dance), the same sequence of movements can be performed in a wide range of ways characterized by different qualities, often in terms of subtle (spatial and temporal) perturbations of the movement. Even a non-expert observer can distinguish between a top-level and average performance by a dancer or martial artist. The difference is not in the performed movements--the same in both cases--but in the “quality” of their performance.In this article, we present a computational framework aimed at an automated approximate measure of movement quality in full-body physical activities. Starting from motion capture data, the framework computes low-level (e.g., a limb velocity) and high-level (e.g., synchronization between different limbs) movement features. Then, this vector of features is integrated to compute a value aimed at providing a quantitative assessment of movement quality approximating the evaluation that an external expert observer would give of the same sequence of movements.Next, a system representing a concrete implementation of the framework is proposed. Karate is adopted as a testbed. We selected two different katas (i.e., detailed choreographies of movements in karate) characterized by different overall attitudes and expressions (aggressiveness, meditation), and we asked seven athletes, having various levels of experience and age, to perform them. Motion capture data were collected from the performances and were analyzed with the system. The results of the automated analysis were compared with the scores given by 14 karate experts who rated the same performances. Results show that the movement-quality scores computed by the system and the ratings given by the human observers are highly correlated (Pearson’s correlations r = 0.84, p = 0.001 and r = 0.75, p = 0.005).",

		"abstract": "Scopo \nNello sport, la fluidità è stata finora scarsamente considerata, principalmente a causa della mancanza di una tecnologia adeguata a misurarla, specie nel caso di sport praticati in ampi spazi aperti. \nTuttavia, misurare la fluidità del movimento nello sport può essere importante a causa del legame di questo parametro con l'efficienza energetica e con la corretta esecuzione del movimento. Infatti misurare la fluidità del movimento può migliorare la comprensione delle fasi critiche del movimento e coadiuvare la valutazione dei risultati di allenamento e riabilitazione. \nAbbiamo scelto di esaminare il parkour perché è un'attività acrobatica che si svolge all'aperto, ma allo stesso tempo comporta schemi di movimento che possono essere riprodotti anche lungo un breve percorso. \nAbbiamo anche dedicato una parte di questo progetto alla applicazione del sistema sviluppato nel dominio degli sport più tradizionali, e abbiamo scelto il salto degli ostacoli perché è molto simile al parkour in termini di movimenti richiesti. \nPiù in dettaglio, lo scopo di questo studio era di sviluppare un sistema per misurare quantitativamente i parametri rilevanti per la fluidità, secondo la letteratura esistente; vale a dire esitazione, \"smoothness\" e coordinazione. \nAbbiamo testato l'affidabilità di tale sistema per misurare le differenze tra gli atleti. Abbiamo anche cercato di valutare i miglioramenti dovuti alla ripetizione della stessa prestazione nel tempo. \nMetodi \nI partecipanti sono stati divisi in due gruppi: principianti (1,5-5 anni di esperienza) e avanzati (> 5 anni di esperienza) ed è stato chiesto loro di completare un percorso composto da una sequenza di tre movimenti (Mov1, Mov2 e Mov3). Durante la prestazione, i dati sono stati raccolti mediante un sistema basato su un numero variable da uno a cinque IMU. Le misurazioni sono state ottenute durante tre ripetizioni successive del percorso da parte di ciascun atleta (Test1, Test2, Test3). \nSono state effettuate quattro sessioni di misurazione. La prima ha coinvolto 17 atleti di parkour e mirava a misurare l'esitazione e la \"smoothness\". \nLa seconda ha coinvolto dieci atleti di parkour su un percorso simile e mirava a misurare la coordinazione. \nLa terza ha coinvolto 12 partecipanti e mirava a misurare la \"smoothness\" nella routine di salto ad ostacoli. \nNella quarta parte i dati raccolti dagli IMU su cinque partecipanti sono stati confrontati con i dati forniti da un sistema optoelettronico, con finalità di validazione. \nAbbiamo valutato la fluidità in termini di \"smoothness\", esitazione e coordinazione, con procedure sviluppate in MATLAB. \nLa smoothness è stata calcolata come l'inverso del numero di inflessioni sul grafico del \"jerk\" (terza derivata dello spostamento). L'esitazione è stata calcolata come il calo percentuale della velocità del centro di massa. \nLa coordinazione, è state definita come la sovrapposizione temporale, calcolata come frazione di movimento normalizzato, in cui le articolazioni interessate (anca e ginocchio) si flettono e si estendono alternativamente.  \nSono state misurate le differenze tra principianti e atleti avanzati e tra le successive ripetizioni del percorso. \nIl test Kruskal-Wallis e il test Friedman sono stati utilizzati per valutare la significatività dei risultati. \nRisultati \nLe differenze nell'esitazione sono risultate statisticamente significative (p <0,05) per distinguere i principianti dagli atleti avanzati solo sul Mov 2. \nUn'analisi qualitativa dell'esitazione è stata utile per mostrare differenze visive nelle curve. \nPer quanto riguarda la smoothness, nel parkour, il numero di inflessioni passanti per la linea di base era significativamente inferiore negli atleti avanzati rispetto ai principianti solo durante il Mov3 (arrampicata). \nInvece, nel salto ad ostacoli, tutti e tre i movimenti, considerate sia separatamente che nel loro insieme, hanno mostrato significatività. Per quanto riguarda la coordinazione, le differenze erano evidenti solo su movimenti meno complicati, come l'atto di saltare o semplicemente camminare. \nNessuno dei tre parametri ha fornito risultati utili per valutare l'evoluzione della fluidità con la ripetizione dell'esercizio. \nConclusione \nIl sistema basato sugli IMU si è dimostrato affidabile e utilizzabile sul campo, durante le attività sportive all'aperto, anche per valutare movimenti acrobatici complessi. \nLe inflessioni del \"jerk\" sono il parametro su cui concentrarsi per valutare la fluidità del movimento in attività complesse come il parkour. \nL'analisi dell'esitazione ha gettato le basi per un approccio più approfondito, che può includere test statistici grafici nel campo dell'analisi funzionale multivariata statistica dei profili temporali. \nLo studio della coordinazione è stato limitato dalla complessità dei movimenti, specialmente quando questi non sono risultati scomponibili in elementi più semplici. \nI risultati di questo studio possono fornire la base per ricerche future. In particolare, potrebbe essere interessante lavorare su sistemi che consentano l'interpolazione automatizzata dei tre parametri di fluidità.",

		"abstract": "Background\nThe Box and Block Test (BBT) is an essential and widely used test in rehabilitation for the assessment of gross unilateral manual dexterity. Although it is a valid, simple, and ecological instrument, it does not provide a quantitative measure of the upper limb trajectories during the test.\nResearch question\nThe study introduces a new motion-capture-based method (using ecological Inertial Measurement Units - IMUs) to evaluate upper body kinematics while performing a targeted version of BBT (tBBT).\nMethods\nThis observational study compares data from 35 healthy subjects, 35 subjects with Parkinson’s disease, and 35 post-stroke individuals to evaluate upper limb kinematics during tBBT quantitatively. Seven IMUs were placed on the trunk, head, and upper limb of each subject. The joint angles and kinematic scores were calculated and analyzed. Motor task execution time and kinematic scores were statistically correlated with clinical assessment measures. Kruskal-Wallis between groups test and Dunn-Bonferroni post-hoc were used.\nResults\nThe statistics revealed significant differences (p<0.05) among the three groups. The analyzed joint angles highlight various compensatory strategies in neurological subjects, such as using the trunk to complete a motor task instead of the shoulder and using the wrist instead of the elbow, along with differences in movement fluidity (DimensionLess-Jerk, p<0.05). A positive correlation was found between kinematics and the Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Limb (r=0.7344; p<0.01), and a negative correlation between kinematics and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (r=-0.5286; p<0.01).\nSignificance\nThe quantitative assessments of joint kinematics correlated to clinical assessments could guarantee a new method of assessment of the upper limb in subjects with motor deficits. This would allow to capture new insight into the characteristics of the subject’s disability, with implications for the choice of a personalized rehabilitation treatment focused on the motor recovery of the upper limb.",

In particular, our algorithm is developed in the framework of the EU-H2020-ICT Project DANCE aiming at investigating techniques for sensory substitution in blind people, in order to enable perception of and participation in non-verbal, artistic whole-body experiences. The algorithm was tested by applying it to a reference archive of short dance performances. The archive includes a collection of both impulsive and fluid movements.

In this perspective, a particular focus is on dance and music as first-class conveyors of expressive and emotional content. Research outputs include (i) computational models of expressive gesture, (ii) validation by means of continuous ratings on spectators exposed to real artistic stimuli, and (iii) novel hardware and software components for the EyesWeb open platform (www.eyesweb.org), such as the recently developed Expressive Gesture Processing Library. The paper starts with a definition of expressive gesture. A unifying framework for the analysis of expressive gesture is then proposed. Finally, two experiments on expressive gesture in dance and music are discussed.

The purpose of our research is to design and evaluate interactive reflexive visuals for movement qualities. The theoretical basis for this research is drawn from a collaboration with the members of the international dance company Emio Greco|PC to study their formalization of movement qualities. We designed a pedagogical interactive installation called Double Skin/Double Mind (DS/DM) for the analysis and visualization of movement qualities through physical model-based interactive renderings.In this article, we first evaluate dancers’ perception of the visuals as metaphors for movement qualities. This evaluation shows that, depending on the physical model parameterization, the visuals are capable of generating dynamic behaviors that the dancers associate with DS/DM movement qualities. Moreover, we evaluate dance students’ and professionals’ experience of the interactive visuals in the context of a dance pedagogical workshop and a professional dance training. The results of these evaluations show that the dancers consider the interactive visuals to be a reflexive system that encourages them to perform, improves their experience, and contributes to a better understanding of movement qualities. Our findings support research on interactive systems for real-time analysis and visualization of movement qualities, which open new perspectives in movement-based interaction design.",

		"abstract": "Wearables integrating movement sonification can support body-perception changes and related physical activity; yet, we lack design principles for such sonifications. Through two mixed-methods studies, we investigate sound pitch and movement direction interaction effects on self-perception during squat exercises. We measured effects on body perception, affective quality of the experience, and actual and perceived movement, and compared them with two control conditions: no-sound and vibrotactile feedback. Results show that regardless of movement direction, ascending pitch enhances several body feelings and overall experience quality, while descending pitch increases movement acceleration. These effects were moderated by exercise physical demand. Sound and vibrotactile feedback enhanced flexibility and strength feelings, respectively, and contributed to exercise completion in different ways. Sound was perceived as an internal-to-body force while vibrotactile feedback was perceived as an external-to-body force. Feedback effects were stronger in people with lower fitness levels. We discuss results in terms of malleability of body perceptions and highlight opportunities to support demanding physical activity through wearable devices.",

		"abstract": "This study examined the influence of the naturalness of a sonic feedback on the perceived usability and pleasantness of the sounds used in a human-computer interface. The interface was the keyboard of an Automatic Teller Machine. The naturalness of the feedback was manipulated by using different kinds of relationship between a keystroke and its sonic feedback: causal, iconic, and arbitrary. Users were required to rate the naturalness, usability, and pleasantness of the sounds before and after manipulating the interface. Two kinds of interfaces were used: a normally functioning and a defective interface. The results indicated that the different relationships resulted in different levels of naturalness: causal mappings resulted in sounds perceived as natural, and arbitrary mappings in sounds perceived as non-natural, regardless of whether the sounds were recorded or synthesized. Before the subjects manipulated the interface, they rated the natural sounds as more pleasant and useful than the non-natural sounds. Manipulating the interface exaggerated these judgments for the causal and arbitrary mappings. The feedback sounds ruled by an iconic relationship between the user’s gesture and the resulting sounds were overall positively rated, but were sensitive to a potential contamination by the negative feelings created by a defective interface.",

However, this application domain faces challenges related to the design of meaningful, task-relevant mappings as well as aesthetic qualities of the sonic feedback. A recent mapping design approach is that of using conceptual metaphors based on image schemata and embodied music cognition. In this work, we developed a framework to facilitate the design and real-time exploration of rehabilitation-tailored mappings rooted in a speciﬁc set of music-based conceptual metaphors. The outcome was a prototype system integrating wireless inertial measurement, ﬂexible real-time mapping control and physical modelling-based musical soniﬁcation. We focus on the technical details of the system, and demonstrate mappings that we created through it for two exercises. These will be iteratively honed and evaluated in upcoming usercentered studies. We believe our framework can be a useful tool in musical soniﬁcation design for motor learning applications.",

Tous ces sons et environnements qui font partie de notre quotidien partagent le fait d'avoir été composés. Derrière leur grande disparité, ils relèvent de ce que l'on nomme le design sonore. Sous ses formes commerciales dominantes, ce dernier agit comme un révélateur des évolutions récentes du capitalisme. Lorsqu'il se fonde, bien plus rarement, sur une exigence d'utilité sociale, il peut en revanche devenir un outil d'émancipation. Pour appréhender les spécificités du design sonore, Juliette Volcler entrecroise des cultures industrielles généralement étanches les unes aux autres et tire des fils entre des époques, des pratiques, des secteurs ou des objets auparavant isolés. Optant pour une approche littéraire et subjective, elle applique l'exercice de la critique sonore à l'espace urbain comme à des boissons gazeuses, à des alarmes autant qu'à des installations artistiques. A travers le design sonore et son développement actuel comme outil d'ingénierie sociale se pose plus largement la question politique de l'écoute au 21e siècle. Cet ouvrage invite ainsi les lectrices et lecteurs à opérer un déplacement dans leur manière d'entendre le quotidien et à éveiller une écoute critique.",

The aim of this paper is to familiarise professionals working in different ﬁelds of rehabilitation with SCEDs and provide practical advice on how to design and implement a SCED in clinical rehabilitation practice. Research questions suitable for SCEDs and the different types of SCEDs (e.g., alternating treatment designs, introduction/withdrawal designs and multiple baseline designs) are reviewed. Practical steps in preparing a SCED design are outlined. Examples from different rehabilitation domains are provided throughout the paper. Challenging issues such as the choice of the repeated measure, assessment of generalisation, randomization, procedural ﬁdelity, replication and generalizability of ﬁndings are discussed. Simple rules and resources for data analysis are presented. The utility of SCEDs in physical and rehabilitation medicine (PRM) are discussed.",

For each of these aspects, percentage point differences between baseline and intervention conditions are estimated and quantified for every participant across studies. MVA effect sizes are standardized, and their aggregates are graphically displayed in a manner similar to individual SCED graphs.

In this context, this paper’s objective is to provide an updated, holistic view of this research, in order to enable developers to exploit the different aspects of its multidisciplinary nature. To that end, previous solutions will be briefly described and analyzed from a historical perspective, from the first “Electronic Travel Aids” and early research on sensory substitution or indoor/outdoor positioning, to recent systems based on artificial vision. Thereafter, user-centered design fundamentals are addressed, including the main points of criticism of previous approaches. Finally, several technological achievements are highlighted as they could underpin future feasible designs. In line with this, smartphones and wearables with built-in cameras will then be indicated as potentially feasible options with which to support state-of-art computer vision solutions, thus allowing for both the positioning and monitoring of the user’s surrounding area. These functionalities could then be further boosted by means of remote resources, leading to cloud computing schemas or even remote sensing via urban infrastructure.",

		"abstract": "Blind individuals often report difficulties to navigate and to detect objects placed outside their peri-personal space. Although classical sensory substitution devices could be helpful in this respect, these devices often give a complex signal which requires intensive training to analyze. New devices that provide a less complex output signal are therefore needed. Here, we evaluate a smartphone-based sensory substitution device that offers navigation guidance based on strictly spatial cues in the form of horizontally spatialized sounds. The system uses multiple sensors to either detect obstacles at a distance directly in front of the user or to create a 3D map of the environment (detection and avoidance mode, respectively), and informs the user with auditory feedback. We tested 12 early blind, 11 late blind and 24 blindfolded-sighted participants for their ability to detect obstacles and to navigate in an obstacle course. The three groups did not differ in the number of objects detected and avoided. However, early blind and late blind participants were faster than their sighted counterparts to navigate through the obstacle course. These results are consistent with previous research on sensory substitution showing that vision can be replaced by other senses to improve performance in a wide variety of tasks in blind individuals. This study offers new evidence that sensory substitution devices based on horizontally spatialized sounds can be used as a navigation tool with a minimal amount of training.",

ASSIST features personalized interfaces by considering the unique experiences that BVI individuals have in indoor wayfinding and offers multiple levels of multimodal feedback. After an overview of the technical approach and implementation of the first prototype of the ASSIST system, the results of two pilot studies performed with BVI individuals are presented - a performance study to collect data on mobility (walking speed, collisions, and navigation errors) while using the app, and a usability study to collect user evaluation data on the perceived helpfulness, safety, ease-of-use, and overall experience while using the app. Our studies show that ASSIST is useful in providing users with navigational guidance, improving their efficiency and (more significantly) their safety and accuracy in wayfinding indoors. Findings and user feedback from the studies confirm some of the previous results, while also providing some new insights into the creation of such an app, including the use of customized user interfaces and expanding the types of information provided.",

		"abstract": "This work systematically reviews the assistive technology solutions for pedestrians with visual impairment and reveals that most of the existing solutions address a specific part of the travel problem. Technology-centered approach with limited focus on the user needs is one of the major concerns in the design of most of the systems. State-of-the-art sensor technology and processing techniques are being used to capture details of the surrounding environment. The real challenge is in conveying this information in a simplified and understandable form especially when the alternate senses of hearing, touch, and smell have much lesser perception bandwidth than that of vision. A lot of systems are at prototyping stages and need to be evaluated and validated by the real users. Conveying the required information promptly through the preferred interface to ensure safety, orientation, and independent mobility is still an unresolved problem. Based on observations and detailed review of available literature, the authors proposed that holistic solutions need to be developed with the close involvement of users from the initial to the final validation stages. Analysis reveals that several factors need serious consideration in the design of such assistive technology solutions.",

		"abstract": "This paper considers issues relevant for the design and use of haptic technology for assistive devices for individuals who are blind or visually impaired in some of the major areas of importance: Braille reading, tactile graphics, orientation and mobility. We show that there is a wealth of behavioral research that is highly applicable to assistive technology design. In a few cases, conclusions from behavioral experiments have been directly applied to design with positive results. Differences in brain organization and performance capabilities between individuals who are “early blind” and “late blind” from using the same tactile/haptic accommodations, such as the use of Braille, suggest the importance of training and assessing these groups individually. Practical restrictions on device design, such as performance limitations of the technology and cost, raise questions as to which aspects of these restrictions are truly important to overcome to achieve high performance. In general, this raises the question of what it means to provide functional equivalence as opposed to sensory equivalence.",

		"abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE: This study explored the impact of assistive technology on the well-being of legally blind adults.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: In this mixed-method study, a convenience sample of 86 legally blind adults took an electronic survey. The questionnaire was comprised of demographics, use patterns, and an instrument called TENS-Interface that measured the impact of technology on well-being categories of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Descriptive statistics, reliability, power analysis and bivariate correlations were calculated using SPSS statistical software. Three participants completed follow up semi-structured interviews, which were analysed for themes of technological mediation using NVivo 12 software.\nRESULTS: The TENS-Interface was validated for use with a legally blind population. Descriptive statistics showed a higher mean for autonomy than competence or relatedness. Braille was positively correlated to both autonomy and competence, while screen reader proficiency was related to competence. Daily use of social media, email, instant messaging, and video calls were correlated to relatedness. The technological devices used by interview participants were analysed for technological mediation. Training was identified as an additional theme.\nCONCLUSIONS: Recommendations for practice include providing training to legally blind adults in screen reader use and braille use to support well-being via competence and autonomy. Training is also recommended for this population in the use of social media, email, and video calls to promote well-being through opportunities for relatedness. Further research is recommended to explore instructional methods that are not only efficient, but also meaningful for older adults in the position of losing their vision.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONProviding access to braille instruction and braille assistive technology equipment can promote legally blind adults' well-being by supporting their basic needs for both competence and autonomy.Providing training in screen reader use can promote legally blind adults' well-being by supporting their basic need for competence.Providing training in use of email, social media, video calls, and instant messaging can promote legally blind adults' well-being by supporting their basic need for relatedness.A consideration of technological mediation can allow practitioners to make recommendations that take into account not only efficient task completion, but issues related to meaning and social context.Instruction for adults losing their vision adventitiously needs to address not only efficient task performance, but also meaning and social context.",

Search on databases for scientific publications has been accompanied by web search for commercial devices. Results have been classified by sensory disability and functionality, and analyzed by assistive technology. Complementary analyses have also been carried out on websites of public international agencies, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), and of associations representing sensory disabled persons.\nRESULTS: The reviewed literature provides evidences that sensory substitution aids are able to mitigate in part the deficits in language learning, communication and navigation for deaf, blind and deaf-blind individuals, and that the tactile sense can be a means of communication to provide some kind of information to sensory disabled individuals.\nCONCLUSIONS: A lack of acceptance emerged from the discussion of capabilities and limitations of haptic assistive technologies. Future researches shall go towards miniaturized, custom-designed and low-cost haptic interfaces and integration with personal devices such as smartphones for a major diffusion of sensory aids among disabled. Implications for rehabilitation Systematic review of state of the art of haptic assistive technologies for vision and audition sensory disabilities. Sensory substitution systems for visual and hearing disabilities have a central role in the transmission of information for patients with sensory impairments, enabling users to interact with the not disabled community in daily activities. Visual and auditory inputs are converted in haptic feedback via different actuation technologies. The information is presented in the form of static or dynamic stimulation of the skin. Their effectiveness and ease of use make haptic sensory substitution systems suitable for patients with different levels of disabilities. They constitute a cheaper and less invasive alternative to implantable partial sensory restitution systems. Future researches are oriented towards the optimization of the stimulation parameters together with the development of miniaturized, custom-designed and low-cost aids operating in synergy in networks, aiming to increase patients' acceptability of these technologies.",

Professionals who work with visually impaired people need to know about assistive technologies. The purpose of this study was to analyse the benefits and challenges of assistive technologies by assessing the degree of satisfaction with assistive technologies in different life situations expressed both by users and by professionals.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were collected from 36 individuals with visual impairments and 27 professionals using online questionnaires. Further information was obtained from five individuals with visual impairments through focus group interviews.\nRESULTS: The results show that 26 (72.2%) individuals with visual impairments and almost all professionals (N = 25; 92.6%) acknowledge the benefits of using assistive technology. They recognise the importance of assistive technology in independent living for individuals with visual impairments. However, 27 (75%) individuals with visual impairment and 26 (96.3%) professionals consider financial constraints to be the biggest problem.\nCONCLUSION: More cost-effective technologies need to be developed, and social policies and opportunities created so that every individual with visual impairment can obtain assistive technologies that meet their needs. This would increase the independence of individuals with visual impairments in all areas of life.",

Visual experience facilitates allocentric spatial representation. Behav Brain Res 2013;236:175–79). Here we investigated whether the influence of the visual status on the capacity to represent egocentric and allocentric spatial relations is mediated by the scale of space explored: large-scale (where a haptic+locomotor exploration is required) and small-scale space (where haptic exploration is needed). Our results showed that congenitally blind people had more difficulty in representing spatial information allocentrically with respect to late blind and sighted individuals, but this difficulty was stronger with large-scale than small-scale space. Instead, egocentric performance was better than the allocentric one for all groups, particularly in the small scale condition. These results suggest that visual experience is necessary to develop accurate allocentric representations especially of large-scale spaces. This is probably due to its capacity to convey a large amount of spatial information simultaneously and to its role on the setting up of multisensory brain areas underlying spatial cognition. In the absence of any kind of visual experience, egocentric spatial representations are favored, especially in small-scale space, when the body offers a stable anchor point.",

Congenitally blind, late blind and blindfolded sighted participants haptically learnt a room-sized regularly shaped array of objects, and their spatial memory was tested to determine which spatial reference frame was used. Crucially, the use of an object-based reference frame requires representing the regular structure of the array. We found that blindfolded sighted and late blind participants, that is those with visual experience, showed a preferential use of the object-based or 'allocentric' reference frame. On the contrary, congenitally blind participants preferred a self-based, or egocentric, reference frame. This suggests that, due to its developmental effect on the multisensory brain areas involved in spatial cognition, visual experience is necessary to develop a preference for an object-based, allocentric reference frame.",

Several studies so far have reported a greater difficulty to switch from an allocentric reference frame to an egocentric one than vice-versa. To clarify this effect, the present work measured the cognitive load underlying switching vs. non-switching processes between reference frames through cognitive pupillometry. Participants performed a custom-designed visuo-spatial memory task, while pupil dilation variations were measured with eye-tracking. After memorizing triads of objects, participants provided judgments of relative distance in non-switching (only-egocentric, only-allocentric) and switching (from-ego-to-allo, from-allo-to-ego) conditions. The results showed a larger pupil dilation in switching judgments from-allocentric-to-egocentric reference frames than from-egocentric-to-allocentric ones. Moreover, pupil evoked-responses were also larger in allocentric- than egocentric-based non-switching conditions. Overall, the results showed that, for both non-switching and switching visuo-spatial processes, starting from an allocentric-based representation elicits a higher cognitive load than starting from an egocentric-based one. Thus, the disproportional effort in visuo-spatial switching processes seems to be determined by the first reference frame adopted that, in turn, contaminates also the following one.",

		"abstract": "Many everyday spatial activities require the cooperation or switching between egocentric (subject-to-object) and allocentric (object-to-object) spatial representations. The literature on blind people has reported that the lack of vision (congenital blindness) may limit the capacity to represent allocentric spatial information. However, research has mainly focused on the selective involvement of egocentric or allocentric representations, not the switching between them. Here we investigated the effect of visual deprivation on the ability to switch between spatial frames of reference. To this aim, congenitally blind (long-term visual deprivation), blindfolded sighted (temporary visual deprivation) and sighted (full visual availability) participants were compared on the Ego-Allo switching task. This task assessed the capacity to verbally judge the relative distances between memorized stimuli in switching (from egocentric-to-allocentric: Ego-Allo; from allocentric-to-egocentric: Allo-Ego) and non-switching (only-egocentric: Ego-Ego; only-allocentric: Allo-Allo) conditions. Results showed a difficulty in congenitally blind participants when switching from allocentric to egocentric representations, not when the first anchor point was egocentric. In line with previous results, a deficit in processing allocentric representations in non-switching conditions also emerged. These findings suggest that the allocentric deficit in congenital blindness may determine a difficulty in simultaneously maintaining and combining different spatial representations. This deficit alters the capacity to switch between reference frames specifically when the first anchor point is external and not body-centered.",

		"abstract": "Valuable insights into the role played by visual experience in shaping spatial representations can be gained by studying the effects of visual deprivation on the remaining sensory modalities. For instance, it has long been debated how spatial hearing evolves in the absence of visual input. While several anecdotal accounts tend to associate complete blindness with exceptional hearing abilities, experimental evidence supporting such claims is, however, matched by nearly equal amounts of evidence documenting spatial hearing deficits. The purpose of this review is to summarize the key findings which support either enhancements or deficits in spatial hearing observed following visual loss and to provide a conceptual framework that isolates the specific conditions under which they occur. Available evidence will be examined in terms of spatial dimensions (horizontal, vertical, and depth perception) and in terms of frames of reference (egocentric and allocentric). Evidence suggests that while early blind individuals show superior spatial hearing in the horizontal plane, they also show significant deficits in the vertical plane. Potential explanations underlying these contrasting findings will be discussed. Early blind individuals also show spatial hearing impairments when performing tasks that require the use of an allocentric frame of reference. Results obtained with late-onset blind individuals suggest that early visual experience plays a key role in the development of both spatial hearing enhancements and deficits.",

		"abstract": "Several works have demonstrated that visual experience plays a critical role in the development of allocentric spatial coding. Indeed, while children with a typical development start to code space by relying on allocentric landmarks from the first year of life, blind children remain anchored to an egocentric perspective until late adolescence. Nonetheless, little is known about when and how visually impaired children acquire the ability to switch from an egocentric to an allocentric frame of reference across childhood. This work aims to investigate whether visual experience is necessary to shift from bodily to external frames of reference. Children with visual impairment and normally sighted controls between 4 and 9 years of age were asked to solve a visual switching-perspective task requiring them to assume an egocentric or an allocentric perspective depending on the task condition. We hypothesize that, if visual experience is necessary for allocentric spatial coding, then visually impaired children would have been impaired to switch from egocentric to allocentric perspectives. Results support this hypothesis, confirming a developmental delay in the ability to update spatial coordinates in visually impaired children. It suggests a pivotal role of vision in shaping allocentric spatial coding across development.",

		"abstract": "The distinction between different spatial representations in the peripersonal space was examined in two experiments by requiring sighted blindfolded and blind participants to remember the locations of objects haptically explored. In experiment 1, object relocation took place from either the same position as learning-with the same (centred egocentric condition) or 90 degrees-rotated (rotated egocentric condition) object array-or from a position different from the learning position (allocentric condition). Results revealed that, in both sighted and blind people, distance errors were higher in the allocentric and rotated conditions than in the centred egocentric condition, and that blind participants made more distance errors than sighted subjects only in the allocentric condition. Experiment 2 repeated rotated egocentric and allocentric conditions, while the centred egocentric condition was replaced by a decentred egocentric condition in which object relocation took place from the same position as learning (egocentric) but started from a decentred point. The decentred egocentric condition was found to remain significantly different from the rotated condition, but not from the allocentric condition. Moreover, blind participants performed less well in the allocentric condition, but were specifically impaired. Overall, our results confirm that different types of spatial constraints and representations, including the decentred egocentric one, can be distinguished in the peripersonal space and that blind people are as efficient as sighted in the egocentric and rotated conditions, but they encounter difficulties in recalling locations also in the peripersonal space, especially when an allocentric condition is required.",

Participants memorized through haptic (congenitally blind, adventitiously blind, and blindfolded) and haptic + visual (sighted) exploration triads of 3D objects and then they were asked to judge: \"which object was closest/farthest to you?\" (egocentric-coordinate); \"which object was on your left/right?\" (egocentric-categorical); \"which object was closest/farthest to a target object (e.g., cone)?\" (allocentric-coordinate); \"which object was on the left/right of the target object (e.g., cone)?\" (allocentric-categorical). The results showed a slowdown in processing time when congenitally blind people provided allocentric-coordinate judgments and adventitiously blind people egocentric-categorical judgments. Moreover, in egocentric judgments, adventitiously blind participants were less accurate than sighted participants. However, the overall performance was quite good and this supports the idea that the differences observed are more quantitative than qualitative. The theoretical implications of these results are discussed.",

It is implemented as a web-based application to facilitate accessible audio parameter mapping of movement data for non-experts, and applied and evaluated with Swedish folk musicians and dancers in their exploration of sonifying dance. SonifyFOLK is based on the WebAudioXML Soniﬁcation Toolkit and is designed within a group of artists and engineers using artistic goals as drivers for the sound design. The design addresses challenges of providing an accessible interface for mapping movement data to audio parameters, managing multi-dimensional data and creating audio mapping templates for a contextually grounded sound design. The evaluation documents a diversity of soniﬁcation outcomes, reﬂections by participants that imply curiosity for further work on soniﬁcation, as well as the importance of the immediacy of the both visual and acoustic feedback of parameter choices.",

		"abstract": "Since the end of the 1980s, interactive musical systems have played an increasingly relevant role in dance performances. More recently, the use of interactive auditory feedback for sensorimotor learning such as movement sonification has gained currency and scientific attention in a variety of fields ranging from rehabilitation to sport training, neuroscience and product design. This paper investigates the convergence between interactive music/dance systems and movement sonification in the field of dance. The main question we address is whether the emergence of the notion of sonification can foster new perspectives for practice-based artistic research. In this context, we highlight a fundamental shift of perspective from musical interactivity per se to the somatic knowledge provided by the real time sonification of movement, which can be considered as a major somatic-sonification turn.",

Consistent findings from the three experiments indicated that sounds expressing fluidity generally occupy a lower register and has less high frequency content, as well as a lower bandwidth, than sounds expressing nonfluidity. The ideal sound to express fluidity is continuous, calm, slow, pitched, reminiscent of wind, water or an acoustic musical instrument. The ideal sound to express nonfluidity is harsh, non-continuous, abrupt, dissonant, conceptually associated with metal or wood, unhuman and robotic. Findings presented in this paper can be used as design guidelines for future applications in which the movement property fluidity is to be conveyed through sonification.",

The library is designed to assist developers and creative coders in the appropriation and usage of the Interactive Machine Learning concepts and workflow, as well as to simplify development of new applications. The library is open-source, based on web standards and released under the BSD-3-Clause Licence. At its higher level, the toolkit proposes Elements, a template application designed towards non-developer users. The application specifically aims at providing a mean for researchers and designers to prototype new movement-based distributed Interactive Machine Learning scenarios. The application allows to create a new scenario by simply providing a JSON configuration file that defines the role and the abilities of each client. The application has been iteratively tested and developed in the context of several workshops.",

		"abstract": "Communicating an auditory experience with words is a difficult task and, in consequence, people often rely on imitative non-verbal vocalizations and gestures. This work explored the combination of such vocalizations and gestures to communicate auditory sensations and representations elicited by non-vocal everyday sounds. Whereas our previous studies have analyzed vocal imitations, the present research focused on gestural depictions of sounds. To this end, two studies investigated the combination of gestures and non-verbal vocalizations. A first, observational study examined a set of vocal and gestural imitations of recordings of sounds representative of a typical everyday environment (ecological sounds) with manual annotations. A second, experimental study used non-ecological sounds whose parameters had been specifically designed to elicit the behaviors highlighted in the observational study, and used quantitative measures and inferential statistics. The results showed that these depicting gestures are based on systematic analogies between a referent sound, as interpreted by a receiver, and the visual aspects of the gestures: auditory-visual metaphors. The results also suggested a different role for vocalizations and gestures. Whereas the vocalizations reproduce all features of the referent sounds as faithfully as vocally possible, the gestures focus on one salient feature with metaphors based on auditory-visual correspondences. Both studies highlighted two metaphors consistently shared across participants: the spatial metaphor of pitch (mapping different pitches to different positions on the vertical dimension), and the rustling metaphor of random fluctuations (rapidly shaking of hands and fingers). We interpret these metaphors as the result of two kinds of representations elicited by sounds: auditory sensations (pitch and loudness) mapped to spatial position, and causal representations of the sound sources (e.g. rain drops, rustling leaves) pantomimed and embodied by the participants’ gestures.",

		"abstract": "Embodied sound design is a process of sound creation that involves the designer’s vocal apparatus and gestures. The possibilities of vocal sketching were investigated by means of an art installation. An artist–designer interpreted several vocal self-portraits and rendered the corresponding synthetic sketches by using physics-based and concatenative sound synthesis. Both synthesis techniques afforded a broad range of artificial sound objects, from concrete to abstract, all derived from natural vocalisations. The vocal-to-synthetic transformation process was then automated in SEeD, a tool allowing to set and play interactively with physics- or corpus-based sound models. The voice-driven process and tool, developed and evaluated through design exercises, show how an embodied sound sketching system can work in supporting the externalisation of sonic concepts.",

		"abstract": "PURPOSE: There are about 2.2 billion people with visual impairment all over the world. In order to improve the quality of life for visually impaired people, various devices have been developed that support the users to make them capable of performing everyday work. There have been considerable advancements in the development of assistive devices over the last few decades. This work aims to review the research work of past decade to explore the technologies used in the assistive devices for the mobility of the people with visual impairment. It focuses on range sensors based (RSB) solutions and to present a comprehensive comparison for researchers to improve the quality of the assistive devices.\nMETHODS: In order to improve life quality of about 2.2 billion people with visual impairment in the world, various assistive devices have been developed. This work aims to review the research work of past decade to explore the technologies used in the assistive devices for the mobility of the people with visual impairment. It focuses on RSB solutions and their comparison.\nRESULTS: Various devices developed or the people with visual impairment, in last decade are described along with their workings. Authors also introduced, their own, newly developed assistive device for the people with visual impairment. The feedback from the people with visual impairment, about assistive technology, is also included in the paper.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study will benefit researchers developing assistive devices to help for the mobility of the people with visual impairment. Through user feedback and evaluation of the assistive devices, the authors have come to the conclusion that performance, weight and cost of the assistive devices are always important considerations to make the assistive devices more popular among their users.Implication for rehabilitationAlthough assistive device cannot rehabilitate a visually impaired person, range sensor-based assistive device may have following implications:•Use of assistive device is growing, and performance, weight and cost of assistive devices are always important considerations so that proposed technology solution should widely be accepted and adopted by the visually impaired people.•The adaptability and acceptability of an assistive device by the visually impaired people must be considered during design phase.•Proposed assistive technological solutions should meet all the needed functions.•Performance of these devices should be assessed in application context so that these devices may help the visually impaired to perform their tasks independently.•At the end, a new light weight and low-cost device developed by authors, is also given, that could be used to assist the visually impaired people to move independently.",

		"abstract": "Since the publication of their inaugural paper on the topic in 2006, Braun and Clarke’s approach has arguably become one of the most thoroughly delineated methods of conducting thematic analysis (TA). However, confusion persists as to how to implement this specific approach to TA appropriately. The authors themselves have identified that many researchers who purport to adhere to this approach—and who reference their work as such—fail to adhere fully to the principles of ‘reflexive thematic analysis’ (RTA). Over the course of numerous publications, Braun and Clarke have elaborated significantly upon the constitution of RTA and attempted to clarify numerous misconceptions that they have found in the literature. This paper will offer a worked example of Braun and Clarke’s contemporary approach to reflexive thematic analysis with the aim of helping to dispel some of the confusion regarding the position of RTA among the numerous existing typologies of TA. While the data used in the worked example has been garnered from health and wellbeing education research and was examined to ascertain educators’ attitudes regarding such, the example offered of how to implement the RTA would be easily transferable to many other contexts and research topics.",

		"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the measurement properties of an expanded version of the Falls Efficacy Scale (FES)-a measure of fear of falling. The original FES measures fear on almost exclusively indoor activities, which may limit the usefulness of the scale in identifying early stages of fear of falling in active community-dwelling older people.\nDESIGN: Two-group convenience sample.\nSETTING: An outpatient referral clinic, and community-dwelling older people recruited from various sources.\nSUBJECTS: A volunteer sample of 111 healthy community-dwelling elderly (mean age 74.0 years) and a sample of 68 older people referred to a Falls and Balance Clinic (FBC) (mean age 79.2). Twenty-one subjects (9 healthy elderly and 12 FBC patients) were tested twice 1 week apart to investigate retest reliability.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A 14-activity questionnaire (the Modified Falls Efficacy Scale [MFES]) was used that incorporated the original 10-activity FES and four additional activities. Falls efficacy was rated on a 10-point visual analogue scale for each activity.\nRESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The MFES demonstrated high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha.95) and less skew than the original FES (-2.4 and -3.3, respectively). Factor analysis of the MFES revealed two factors accounting for 75% of the sample variance, grouping into an \"indoor type activity\" factor and an \"outdoor type activity\" factor. Retest reliability for the MFES was high (intraclass correlation coefficients = .93). Significant differences were evident between the FBC group and the healthy older group on all items of the MFES and on the total MFES score (p < .05). On the basis of these preliminary findings, the MFES appears to be a reliable and valid measure of falls self-efficacy, and could be a useful addition in the comprehensive assessment of older people with balance disturbance or falls.",

The HADS' internal consistency and discriminant validity were assessed, its factor structure was evaluated, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were undertaken to evaluate its case finding abilities.\nRESULTS: The HADS-FC had good reliability (Cronbach's alphas ranging from 0.79 to 0.89 depending on language version and subscales) and discriminant validity, and a two-factor structure reflecting anxiety and depression factors. Results were similar in patient subgroups with or without multimorbidity. Optimal cut-off values were calculated: HADS: ≥ 16 (sensitivity 62%, specificity 77%), HADS-A: ≥ 10 (sensitivity 66%, specificity 73%) and HADS-D:≥ 7 (sensitivity 65%, specificity 75%).\nLIMITATIONS: Our cohort selection process and use of the CIDIS as a gold standard may have contributed to the limited case-finding performance of the HADS-FC.\nCONCLUSIONS: The HADS-FC and English HADS presented good psychometric properties in primary care patients, including patients with and without multimorbidity. However, its performance as a screening instrument in these settings with patients of varying clinical profiles requires more scrutiny.",

Un prétest a été effectué sur 26 participants. Les caractéristiques de la version française de l’AttrakDiff 2 ont ensuite été évaluées par une étude quantitative en ligne sur un échantillon de 381 utilisateurs.\nRésultats\nLes résultats des analyses effectuées confirment la structure factorielle attendue en 3 facteurs et une bonne consistance interne des sous-échelles. Les liens entre les facteurs sont consistants avec le modèle théorique d’Hassenzahl (2003) où attributs pragmatiques et hédoniques perçus se combinent pour former un jugement d’attractivité.\nConclusion\nLa présente version française de l’AttrakDiff 2 est globalement conforme à la version initiale allemande de l’outil et présente des niveaux de validité et de fidélité satisfaisants.\nIntroduction\nWhile user experience (UX) evaluation is a core concern within the field of human–computer interaction (HCI), there is currently no valid self-administered UX evaluation tool in French. The AttrakDiff 2 scale (Hassenzahl, Burmester, & Koller, 2003) is a UX evaluation tool, which relies on a theoretical model distinguishing pragmatic and hedonic qualities of interactive systems.\nObjective\nThis paper describes the translation and validation of the French version of the AttrakDiff 2 scale in order to ease UX assessment in French-speaking users.\nMethod\nFollowing the cross-cultural methodology developed by Vallerand (1989), the questionnaire was translated by trilingual researchers before being back-translated and validated by a panel of experts. A pre-test was conducted on 26 participants. The characteristics of the French version of the AttrakDiff 2 scale were then evaluated through a quantitative online study involving a sample of 381 users.\nResults\nThe results confirm the expected 3 factors structure and a good internal consistency of each subscale. The links between factors are consistent with Hassenzahl's theoretical model (2003) where pragmatic and hedonic perceived attributes combine to form a judgment of attractiveness.\nConclusion\nThe current French version of the AttrakDiff 2 scale is globally reliable with regards to the initial German version and presents satisfactory levels of validity and reliability.",

		"abstract": "Body awareness refers to the individual ability to process signals originating from within the body, which provide a mapping of the body's internal landscape (interoception) and its relation with space and movement (proprioception). The present study aims to evaluate psychometric properties and validate in French two self-report measures of body awareness: the Postural Awareness Scale (PAS), and the last version of the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness questionnaire (version 2, MAIA-2). We collected data in a non-clinical, adult sample (N = 308; 61% women, mean age 35 ± 12 years) using online survey, and a subset of the original sample (n = 122; 62% women, mean age 44 ± 11 years) also completed the retest control. Factor analyses and reliability analyses were conducted. Construct validity of the PAS and the MAIA-2 were examined by testing their association with each other, and with self-report measures of personality (Big Five Inventory), alexithymia (Toronto Alexithymia Scale) and dispositional trait mindfulness (Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory). Factor analyses of the PAS supported the same two-factor structure as previously published versions (in other languages). For the MAIA-2, factor analyses suggested that a six-factor structure, excluding Not-Worrying and Not-Distracting factors, could successfully account for a common general factor of self-reported interoception. We found satisfactory internal consistency, construct validity, and reliability over time for both the PAS and the MAIA-2. Altogether, our findings suggest that the French version of the PAS and the MAIA-2 are reliable self-report tools to assess both components of body awareness (proprioception and interoception dimension, respectively).",

Interviews were transcribed, coded and analysed by two independent researchers.\nRESULTS: Seven themes emerged from interviews. Changes in patients' identity, achievement and future life projection arose as being the main transformations caused by vision loss. Self-awareness of impairment appeared associated with the patients' first contact with their loss, while self-identification with the impairment arose connected with the later embodiment process of the vision loss.\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients' self-awareness and self-perceptions of impairment appear to be two important milestones in the adjustment process to vision loss. Their assessment and monitoring over the rehabilitation period might help to promote impairment acceptance and rehabilitation outcomes.",

However, about some users such as those with visual impairments, there is little information available for use in designing products and spaces. There is also a gap in information regarding the commutes and needs of the visually impaired, making it even more difficult to establish how environments should be designed to include this population.This study aimed to identify the information needs of people with visual impairment in terms of: 1) Daily life activities, 2) Wayfinding in the complex built environments, 3) Use of the signals provided by the environment 4) Characteristics of the environment which reduce the usability of a space and may put the user in danger, and 5) Safety perception. Data were obtained through a semi-structured interview to which eighteen adults responded. All had either complete blindness or severe visual impairment. For orientation, the most common references were texture or changes in ground level/surface, along with such ambient elements as noise or smells. Information presented in Braille was reported as little used, due to difficulty in finding such information. Regarding safety, participants reported feeling unsafe; most mentioned crossing the street as a major risk. Using auditory, tactile or even olfactory signals may provide important information while commuting: thus, designing signals which consider and highlight these senses is paramount. Assessing features and location of existing tactile signals is also required, to identify opportunities for improving the safety and independence of people with visual impairment.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Over 50% of adults with visual impairment experience severe fatigue. Therefore, we developed a guided E-health intervention based on cognitive behavioral therapy and self-management to reduce fatigue in this population. This pilot study evaluated the usability, feasibility, fidelity and potential effectiveness of E-nergEYEze.\nMETHODS: E-nergEYEze was developed by a design team and customized by conducting a pilot study using an iterative development strategy. The intervention was first tested in a usability study among adults with visual impairment (n = 5). Participants were asked to think-aloud while exploring the intervention features and a semi-structured interview was performed afterwards. Subsequently, the enhanced intervention was tested in a feasibility study. Adults with visual impairment and severe fatigue (n = 10) followed the intervention partially with guidance from a social worker and one-time computer trainer support. Fatigue severity (Checklist Individual Strength), fatigue impact (Modified Fatigue Impact Scale) and cognitive behavioral therapy skills (Competencies of Cognitive Therapy Scale-Self Report) were measured at baseline and at three months follow-up and analyzed with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The intervention was evaluated through evaluation forms.\nRESULTS: The usability study resulted in adjustments to content and lay-out with regard to optically shortened text sentences, separate pages for information and assignments with one read-aloud audio and an additional descriptive explanation of page content. Digital challenges were overcome with mandatory computer training and e-platform modifications. The feasibility study showed a positive trend in reducing fatigue severity (Z -6.108; P < .001; SD 8.4), impact of fatigue (Z - 4.451; P < .001; SD 11.4) and cognitive behavioral therapy skills (Z -2.278; P = .023; SD 19.3). Participants gave useful feedback regarding accessibility, content and guidance, with an overall positive experience. The intervention was rated with a median score of 8 (range 7-10).\nCONCLUSION: We developed, evaluated and optimized E-nergEYEze by applying a user-centered and iterative approach. E-nergEYEze showed a promising trend to reduce fatigue severity and impact of fatigue and to increase cognitive behavioral therapy skills. The study methods were feasible and the fidelity of the intervention protocol was suitable. Performing a randomized controlled trial is warranted to give insight into whether E-nergEYEze is cost-effective in reducing severe fatigue in adults with visual impairment.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: International Clinical Trial Registry Platform: NL7764.

In this paper, we argue that it offers an accessible and theoretically flexible approach to analysing qualitative data. We outline what thematic analysis is, locating it in relation to other qualitative analytic methods that search for themes or patterns, and in relation to different epistemological and ontological positions. We then provide clear guidelines to those wanting to start thematic analysis, or conduct it in a more deliberate and rigorous way, and consider potential pitfalls in conducting thematic analysis. Finally, we outline the disadvantages and advantages of thematic analysis. We conclude by advocating thematic analysis as a useful and flexible method for qualitative research in and beyond psychology.",

		"abstract": "Sensory substitution devices (SSDs) have been developed with the ultimate purpose of supporting sensory deprived individuals in their daily activities. However, more than forty years after their first appearance in the scientific literature, SSDs still remain more common in research laboratories than in the daily life of people with sensory deprivation. Here, we seek to identify the reasons behind the limited diffusion of SSDs among the blind community by discussing the ergonomic, neurocognitive and psychosocial issues potentially associated with the use of these systems. We stress that these issues should be considered together when developing future devices or improving existing ones. We provide some examples of how to achieve this by adopting a multidisciplinary and participatory approach. These efforts would contribute not solely to address fundamental theoretical research questions, but also to better understand the everyday needs of blind people and eventually promote the use of SSDs outside laboratories.",

		"abstract": "Sensory substitution devices (SSDs) have come a long way since first developed for visual rehabilitation. They have produced exciting experimental results, and have furthered our understanding of the human brain. Unfortunately, they are still not used for practical visual rehabilitation, and are currently considered as reserved primarily for experiments in controlled settings. Over the past decade, our understanding of the neural mechanisms behind visual restoration has changed as a result of converging evidence, much of which was gathered with SSDs. This evidence suggests that the brain is more than a pure sensory-machine but rather is a highly flexible task-machine, i.e., brain regions can maintain or regain their function in vision even with input from other senses. This complements a recent set of more promising behavioral achievements using SSDs and new promising technologies and tools. All these changes strongly suggest that the time has come to revive the focus on practical visual rehabilitation with SSDs and we chart several key steps in this direction such as training protocols and self-train tools.",

Lors d’une recherche menée auprès des spécialistes, les auteurs ont croisé l’Analyse du mouvement selon Laban (Laban Movement Analysis – LMA), et l’Analyse fonctionnelle du corps dans le mouvement dansé (AFCMD) afin de mieux intégrer les dimensions fonctionnelles et expressives du mouvement. Ce croisement a permis d’identifier, d’une part, les processus sous-jacents à l’activité d’observation-analyse du mouvement en passant par l’épistémologie de l’Analyse d’activité, et, d’autre part, de proposer une nouvelle conceptualisation transversale. Celle-ci organise et répartit les différents observables dans les trois sphères d’un diagramme de Venn – le Fond, l’Espace et la Dynamique – plaçant en son cœur l’intégration des dimensions fonctionnelles et expressives. Chacune des sphères est associée à une fonction relationnelle, respectivement les fonctions phorique, haptique et expressive. Les espaces d’intersection créés entre les sphères deviennent des lieux d’action (intention, coordination, engagement) qui mobilisent les différentes fonctions et permettent la « construction du sens » du mouvement observé.",

		"abstract": "With a growing number of electronic devices surrounding our daily life, it becomes increasingly important to create solutions for clear and simple communication and interaction at the human machine interface (HMI). Haptic feedback solutions play an important role as they give a clear direct link and response to the user. This work demonstrates multifunctional haptic feedback devices based on fully printed piezoelectric transducers realized with functional polymers on thin paper substrate. The devices are flexible; lightweight and show very high out-of-plane deflection of 213 µm at a moderate driving voltage of 50 Vrms (root mean square) achieved by an innovative multilayer design with up to five individually controllable active layers. The device creates a very clear haptic sensation to the human skin with a blocking force of 0.6 N at the resonance frequency of 320 Hz, which is located in the most sensitive range of the human fingertip. Additionally the transducer generates audible information above two kilohertz with a remarkable high sound pressure level. Thus the paper-based approach can be used for interactive displays in combination with touch sensation; sound and color prints. The work gives insights into the manufacturing process; the electrical characteristics; and an in-depth analysis of the 3D deflection of the device under variable conditions.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Body awareness (BA) and proprioception, which are essential components of the sense of agency (SA), are often altered in various mental disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the relationship between BA, proprioception, and SA, as well as the methods to manipulate them, remain unclear. This study explored using real-time gesture sonification (GS), i.e., wearable technology transforming body movements into sounds, to enhance proprioception, BA, and thus the SA.\nMETHODS: In this within-subjects design, 17 healthy adults (mean age = 25.5 years) with varying dance expertise (novice, amateur, expert) improvised movements to match sounds with and without auditory feedback from motion sensors on wrists/ankles modulated by their gestures. BA, immersion, pleasure, and self-efficacy were measured.\nRESULTS: Sonification significantly increased body awareness, reward, and immersion (all p < 0.05).\nCONCLUSION: GS can enhance BA and the SA, pleasure, and control during physical activity. This highlights potential mental health applications, such as agency-based therapies for PTSD. Manipulating bodily perception could improve symptoms and embodiment. Further research should replicate this in clinical populations and explore neurocognitive mechanisms.",

		"abstract": "This paper argues that the current proliferation of types of systematic reviews creates challenges for the terminology for describing such reviews. Terminology is necessary for planning, describing, appraising, and using reviews, building infrastructure to enable the conduct and use of reviews, and for further developing review methodology. There is insufficient consensus on terminology for a typology of reviews to be produced and any such attempt is likely to be limited by the overlapping nature of the dimensions along which reviews vary. It is therefore proposed that the most useful strategy for the field is to develop terminology for the main dimensions of variation. Three such main dimensions are proposed: (1) aims and approaches (including what the review is aiming to achieve, the theoretical and ideological assumptions, and the use of theory and logics of aggregation and configuration in synthesis); (2) structure and components (including the number and type of mapping and synthesis components and how they relate); and (3) breadth and depth and the extent of ‘work done’ in addressing a research issue (including the breadth of review questions, the detail with which they are addressed, and the amount the review progresses a research agenda). This then provides an overarching strategy to encompass more detailed descriptions of methodology and may lead in time to a more overarching system of terminology for systematic reviews.",

		"abstract": "PURPOSE: Visually impaired people (VIP) find it challenging to understand and gain awareness of their surroundings. Most activities require the use of the auditory or tactile senses. As such, assistive systems which are capable of aiding visually impaired people to understand, navigate and form a mental representation of their environment are extensively being studied and developed. The aim of this paper is to provide insight regarding the characteristics, as well as the advantages and drawbacks of different types of sonification strategies in assistive systems, to assess their suitability for certain use-cases.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: To this end, we reviewed a sizeable number of assistive solutions for VIP which provide a form of auditory feedback to the user, encountered in different scientific databases (Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ACM and Google Scholar) through direct searches and cross-referencing.\nRESULTS: We classified these solutions based on the aural information they provide to the VIP - alerts, guidance and information about their environment, be it spatial or semantic. Our intention is not to provide an exhaustive review, but to select representative implementations from recent literature that highlight the particularities of each sonification approach.\nCONCLUSIONS: Thus, anyone who is intent on developing an assistive solution will be able to choose the desired sonification class, being aware of the advantages/disadvantages and at the same time having a fairly wide selection of articles from the representative class.",

		"abstract": "The upright stance position is inherently unstable since the smallest deviation from a perfect upright orientation produces forces due to gravity that accelerate the body toward the ground. Stability is achieved by generating appropriate joint torques that correct for deviations from a desired orientation with orientation changes detected by sensory systems (primarily somatosensory/proprioceptive, visual, and vestibular systems). Functionally, balance control can be viewed as a closed-loop feedback control system with the integration of different sources of sensory orientation information being one component of the overall system, but with the system's feedback nature placing constraints on the sensory integration process. Analysis of body sway evoked by balance perturbations allows for the measurement of \"sensory weights\" that represent the relative contributions of different sensory systems to an internal estimate of orientation that, in turn, is used to generate corrective actions. Experiments reveal that sensory weights are not fixed quantities, but vary as a function of environmental and experimental conditions as well as neurologic disorders that affect the quality of sensory information available from different sensory systems. Because environmental conditions can change rapidly, sensory reweighting must also occur rapidly enough to prevent instability due to an under- or overproduction of corrective action.",

		"abstract": "A novel interface for the real-time control of interactive visuals through full body dance movements is designed with a specific focus on the notion of movement qualities (the manner in which the movement is executed). The system can recognise predefined movement qualities through gesture analysis. It also allows for the control of abstract visuals based on physical models, specifically mass-springs models, displaying graphical animations with ‘qualities’ reflecting the participants’ expressions.\n\nThis work has been implemented and tested in an interactive installation called ‘Double Skin/Double Mind’. In that context, we were able to test the contribution of our system to dance pedagogy and to collect participants’ feedback. These preliminary tests suggest that the dancers can embrace the interaction with physical model-based visuals. They also reveal that the movement qualities of the visuals generated by our system fairly mirror the dancers’ own qualities.",

		"abstract": "This paper describes the concept and development of the interactive installation \"Pre-Choreographic Movement Kit\". It utilizes a dance concept as a starting point to use physical objects for generating movements, using sensor-based motion tracking. The \"Pre-Choreographic Movement Kit\" is part of the interdisciplinary research project \"Pre-Choreographic Alphabet\", initiated by Bertha Bermudez and Emio Greco, ICKAmsterdam (International Choreographic Center in Amsterdam) joined by Chris Ziegler (School of Arts Media Engineering ASU, Tempe) for design and development under LABO21. The objective of the research project, is to reflect upon previous artistic work, define methodologies for the articulation of dance experiences using interactive environments for transmission and dissemination of knowledge. Choreographer Emio Greco and Pieter C. Scholten have developed over many years an understanding of dancer's technologies to generate movement material for dance creation. Chris Ziegler cites the idea of \"art in a box\" first developed by George Maciunas \"Fluxkit\" (1964), by designing a playful environment for dancers and non-dancers alike. The \"Pre-Choreographic Movement Kit\" proposes interactive Objects, generating a physical encounter to\"Pre-choreographic Knowledge\" of thinking and performing movements.",

		"abstract": "Movement-sound interactive systems enable interactions with computer-generated sounds through sensing technology, typically wearable motion sensors or cameras. A large body of research has been reported on such systems by communities around New Interfaces for Musical Expressions (NIME), Sound and Music Computing, and Movement & Computing. These works have various applications in music, dance, sports, and rehabilitation. Although this research field has matured in several aspects, the different learning processes implied in designing and performing with such systems remain elusive as they cannot be described or formalized from a unique point of view. This PhD dissertation aims to investigate, through the lens of exploration, the learning and appropriation of movement-sound interactive systems. This work is an interdisciplinary effort combining different methodological approaches from Engineering, Human-Computer Interaction, and Research-Creation. First, interviews with artists, composers, and educators using movement-sound technologies have been carried out to ground our research in artistic and pedagogical contexts. Second, an interactive system named mosX was designed to be useable and adaptable in different research and artistic contexts through various cycles of experiment and technological developments. mosX allows users to explore sound samples through body movements measured by wireless sensors. It uses polyspring, a Python package we developed to manipulate sound database 2-dimensional representations. Polyspring was motivated by a preliminary experiment of movement-sound exploration. Third, a controlled experiment using mosX was conducted, where participants explored a set of sounds mapped to the posture of their dominant arm. Quantitative metrics were created to analyze the exploration, supplemented by qualitative data. The analysis proved relevant for quantifying the space explored by participants and eliciting their experiences and different early learning processes. Fourth, we present, from a first-person perspective, performance-led research utilizing mosX along with other gesture sonification strategies. This research work can thus be seen as a loop between user-centered and participatory design, technology development, and performance-led practices. We found that interactive technologies are rarely the starting point of artistic practice but rather a tool embedded in the socio-cultural context in which artists evolve. It is their experiential qualities that are found to bring something meaningful to the practice, both as a reflector of the action and as a tool to experiment and create beyond norms. Both the interviews and the experiments show that open-ended exploration is a necessary step to understanding the possibilities and limitations of those tools and is an actual part of learning. As interactive systems are at the crossroads of several domains, learning how to use such systems was found to englobe multiple intertwined meanings: understanding the technology that supports them, getting better at crafting meaningful interactions, exploiting the resulting interaction, and ultimately, being able to transmit the related knowledge to others.",

		"abstract": "To design bodily data representations, it is helpful to understand how people move. Bertin codified graphic design principles for data visualization and Hornecker et al. describe a design vocabulary for data physicalization. Yet, few frameworks guide the creation of data representations that use people's bodies as the material for design, or data representations that create a felt experience of data through movement. In this pictorial, we propose a set of movement parameters to serve as building blocks for body-based data representations. Our framework, consisting of six movement parameters each with up to seven sub-parameters, synthesizes the theoretical work of movement experts in Western traditions and contextualizes it in data representation based on a 10-session workshop series with dancers. Two case studies demonstrate how the movement parameters were applied to create bodily data representations intended to be viewed by an audience and bodily data representations intended to be somatically experienced.",

		"abstract": "The performance work Embodied Machine employs several idiosyncratic dance principles as common foundations between choreography, music, and light. The establishment of these foundations is based on a translation of dance principles across different modalities. This process of translation involves the identification of the core aspects of each dance principle, the abstraction of these aspects into computational formalisms, and the re-mediation of the formalisms into perceivable outcomes through sound synthesis, music composition, light, and interaction design. This publication describes the selected dance principles and the process of their translation. It also provides information about the artistic and scientific context that is relevant for this work, namely the role of dance principles in contemporary dance, the inherent proximity between the moving body and music, the methods available for formalising dance principles, and examples of computational approaches for translating dance prinicples. Finally, the publication describes several scenes of the dance performance and highlights the principles that form part of each of them.",

To enable the application of Laban notation in computational movement analysis, measurable physical correlates of Effort and Shape components need to be identified. Such physical correlates enable quantification of Effort and Shape components, which in turn facilitates computational analysis of affective movements. In this work, two existing approaches to quantification of Laban Effort components (Weight, Time, Space, and Flow) based on measurable movement features (position, velocity, acceleration, and jerk) are adapted for hand and arm movements, and a new approach for quantifying Shape Directional based on the average trajectory curvature is proposed. The results show a high correlation between Laban annotations provided by a certified movement analyst (CMA) and the quantified Effort Weight (81%), Time (77%) and Shape Directional (93%) for an affective hand and arm movement dataset.",

LMA is increasingly used in a variety of research ﬁelds, particularly when studying movement expressivity and computation where it is essential to generate an understanding of the observation process. In this paper we articulate the application of LMA as a tool for movement analysis in HCI research by using qualitative methods to deconstruct the observation process of LMA experts. We conducted a focus group in which 12 expert-participants observed and annotated videos of movement according to LMA categories. We transcribed their observation process and analyzed it using grounded theory in order to extract categories, concepts and theories that best explain and describe the process of observation in LMA. By doing so, we open research perspectives in which LMA can be integrated as a method for observation in the design of movement-based computational systems.",

		"abstract": "L'espace péripersonnel (PPS) a  été défini comme l'espace d'action entourant le corps où les individus peuvent facilement interagir avec les objets et les individus. Le PPSagit comme une interface entre perception et action qui pe rmet un encodage multisensoriel des stimuli à proximité et joue un rôle crucial dans l'organisation et l'exécution d'actions visant la protection du corps ou l'interaction avec des objets. Le PPS serait composé de plusieurs champs de réponse, à savoir des portions d'espace dotées d'une valeur fonctionnelle déterminant l'action la plus pertinente à exécuter. Dans ce contexte, l'objectif de la présente thèse était d'évaluer si et comment les facteurs sociaux et moteurs sont intégrés lors de la construction d'une telle représentation fonctionnelle de l'espace. Plus précisément, j'ai testé l'hypothèse selon laquelle, lorsque des facteurs moteurs et sociaux sont simultanément impliqués, les facteurs sociaux moduleraient l'influence des facteurs moteurs sur la construction du PPS. Les deux facettes de la construction des PPS ont été examinées : la représentation du PPS (i.e., la façon dont les individus se représentent l' espace autour de leur corps) et l'exploitation du PPS (i.e., la façon dont les individus agissent dans cet espace). Cinq études ont été menées dans le cadre de la présente thèse. L'étude 1 a montré que lors d'une tâche motrice en collaboration avec autrui, les individus étendent leur représentation du PPS. Cependant, ils ont tendance à éviter d'exploiter l'espace lorsque celui-ci coïncide avec le PPS d'autrui, même lorsqu'il est associé à une plus grande probabilité d'obtenir une récompense suite `a une action motrice. L' étude 2 a montré que cet effet est modulé par l'implication des individus dans la tâche (i.e., agir vs. observer). Les études 3, 4 et 5 ont examiné spécifiquement l'exploitation du PPS et ont montré respectivement qu'en situation d'interaction sociale, l'utilisation de l'espace est modulée par les caractéristiques de la cible spatiale à atteindre à la fin de l'action, la présence du regard d'autrui et le partage d'un espace physique. Par conséquent, alors que les études 1 et 2 ont montré que les facteurs sociaux modulent l'effet des facteurs moteurs, les études 3, 4 et 5 ont suggéré que l'effet inverse est également possible. Ces résultats suggèrent donc que les facteurs sociaux et moteurs sont pris en compte de façon hiérarchique lorsque les individus se représentent et exploitent leur PPS, attribuant une priorité donnée à une portion d'espace donnée durant leurs interactions avec l'environnement. A la lumière de ces résultats et afin d'offrir une vision intégrative de la construction du PPS, la présente thèse propose un modèle fonctionnel du PPS, comprenant trois niveaux inter-connectés et s'influençant mutuellement (une carte des priorités perceptives, une carte des priorités motrices et une étape d'exécution de l'action). Dans une perspective plus large, la présente thèse défend l'idée que la construction du PPS n'est pas stable, mais qu'elle est déterminée à un instant précis par les exigences de la tâche, les caractéristiques des stimuli et le contexte physique et social.",

		"abstract": "Aujourd'hui, l'identité sonore des marques concerne principalement les musiques associées aux publicités ou diffusées sur les points de vente, ainsi que des éléments de communication comme la voix ou les jingles. Dans cette thèse, nous nous intéressons au design sonore des produits et équipements comme vecteur de l'identité de marque. Nous proposons une méthodologie de design sonore identitaire permettant de traduire les valeurs d'une marque en termes sonores, et de véhiculer l'identité sonore ainsi définie sur une série d'objets caractéristiques de la marque. A partir d'une analyse d'un grand nombre d'études sur la perception des sons, nous avons établi un lexique sonore de 35 termes adapté à la description des différentes caractéristiques du son. Nous proposons d'utiliser ce lexique ainsi que différents outils de communication pour traduire les valeurs identitaires d'une marque en termes sonores compréhensibles par tous les acteurs du projet en design sonore. Nous proposons également une méthode d'analyse fonctionnelle permettant de spécifier les contraintes techniques liées à la nature ou à la fonction de l'objet choisi pour véhiculer l'identité. Cette méthode repose sur une expérience d'indexation sonore, inspirée de l'analyse sensorielle. La méthodologie proposée a été appliquée au design de l'identité sonore de la marque SNCF véhiculée à travers différentes sources (alarmes, composteurs, tableau d'affichage,...). Ces travaux ont permis de construire et de tester des méthodologies et outils facilitant la communication dans le design sonore, et ont montré que l'identité des marques pouvait s'exprimer à travers la conception des sons de leurs produits et équipements.",

		"abstract": "The first meetings of a sound design project aim to present the request which may concern the identity of a brand or the sound of a new product. It is then crucial to elaborate recommendations for the sound designer. However, the major difficulty encountered is to specify the request in terms of sound features. The Speak methodology is based on an efficient co-design workshop to help participants to specify their request with words related to sound features. This methodology is based on a lexicon composed of 35 words often used by professionals to described sound features. Each word is related to a sound feature explained by a definition and highlighted by a corpus of sound examples, and is associated with a card used by the participants during the brief meeting. Using this methodology, participants are actively involved in the process to develop sound recommendations.",

		"abstract": "Sound-assisted movement rehabilitation is one of the most interesting and socially relevant applications of sonic interaction research, and existing research shows the potential of movement sonification to enhance patient motivation and movement re-learning. However, this technology is not routinely adopted in practice due to fragmented evidence of clinical effectiveness, feasibility, and usability. A key but little-explored challenge is that of designing and developing sonification systems that can readily be set up, configured, and applied by physiotherapists in a manner compatible with clinical practices and tailorable to individual patient needs and capacities, as well as training goals. In this work, we carried out an iterative user-centered design process to develop a sonification system for clinical gait rehabilitation of hemiparetic patients. This yielded a fully functional system that integrated wireless wearable inertial sensors with a laptop-based software interface for physiotherapists to configure and adjust the feedback on the fly. The feedback was ecologically based (naturalistic wading sounds) and highly individualizable through patient-specific adjustments. The system was evaluated in a real-life clinical feasibility study involving four physiotherapists and seven hemiparetic patients (4M,3F, mean age 56.14 ± 15.45). Overall, the physiotherapists found the system easy to set up and seamless to use during training, although they expressed a need for more system portability, a set of additional feedback configuration functions, and extra training / practice with using the more advanced feedback adjustment controls. While future work should address these findings and systematically explore clinical effectiveness in terms of motor learning outcomes, we believe that this work can serve to guide the design of clinically usable movement sonification systems targeting a breadth of rehabilitative applications.",

To create such a system requires component considerations outside of typical sonification design choices, such as the dimension of movement to sonify, section of anatomy to track, and methodology of motion capture. This review takes this emerging and highly diverse area of literature and keyword-code existing real-time movement sonification systems, to analyze and highlight current trends in these design choices, as such providing an overview of existing systems. A combination of snowballing through relevant existing reviews and a systematic search of multiple databases were utilized to obtain a list of projects for data extraction. The review categorizes systems into three sections: identifying the link between physical dimension to auditory dimension used in sonification, identifying the target anatomy tracked, identifying the movement tracking system used to monitor the target anatomy. The review proceeds to analyze the systematic mapping of the literature and provide results of the data analysis highlighting common and innovative design choices used, irrespective of application, before discussing the findings in the context of movement rehabilitation. A database containing the mapped keywords assigned to each project are submitted with this review.",

		"abstract": "Mobility challenges threaten physical independence and good quality of life. Often, mobility can be improved through gait rehabilitation and specifically the use of cueing through prescribed auditory, visual, and/or tactile cues. Each has shown use to rectify abnormal gait patterns, improving mobility. Yet, a limitation remains, i.e., long-term engagement with cueing modalities. A paradigm shift towards personalised cueing approaches, considering an individual’s unique physiological condition, may bring a contemporary approach to ensure longitudinal and continuous engagement. Sonification could be a useful auditory cueing technique when integrated within personalised approaches to gait rehabilitation systems. Previously, sonification demonstrated encouraging results, notably in reducing freezing-of-gait, mitigating spatial variability, and bolstering gait consistency in people with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Specifically, sonification through the manipulation of acoustic features paired with the application of advanced audio processing techniques (e.g., time-stretching) enable auditory cueing interventions to be tailored and enhanced. These methods used in conjunction optimize gait characteristics and subsequently improve mobility, enhancing the effectiveness of the intervention. The aim of this narrative review is to further understand and unlock the potential of sonification as a pivotal tool in auditory cueing for gait rehabilitation, while highlighting that continued clinical research is needed to ensure comfort and desirability of use.",

		"abstract": "The use of continuous auditory feedback for motor control and learning is still understudied and deserves more attention regarding fundamental mechanisms and applications. This paper presents the results of three experiments studying the contribution of task-, error-, and user-related sonification to visuo-manual tracking and assessing its benefits on sensorimotor learning. First results show that sonification can help decreasing the tracking error, as well as increasing the energy in participant's movement. In the second experiment, when alternating feedback presence, the user-related sonification did not show feedback dependency effects, contrary to the error and task-related feedback. In the third experiment, a reduced exposure of 50% diminished the positive effect of sonification on performance, whereas the increase of the average energy with sound was still significant. In a retention test performed on the next day without auditory feedback, movement energy was still superior for the groups previously trained with the feedback. Although performance was not affected by sound, a learning effect was measurable in both sessions and the user-related group improved its performance also in the retention test. These results confirm that a continuous auditory feedback can be beneficial for movement training and also show an interesting effect of sonification on movement energy. User-related sonification can prevent feedback dependency and increase retention. Consequently, sonification of the user's own motion appears as a promising solution to support movement learning with interactive feedback.",

The system aims to improve movement awareness and physical conditioning, with potential applications in balance rehabilitation and physical therapy. Initial feasibility testing was conducted with a small group of healthy participants performing standing balance tasks with eyes open and closed.

Recently, several studies have shown that additional movement acoustics can enhance motor perception and motor control. Therefore, a new method has been developed that allows providing auditory feedback about arm movement trajectories in real-time for motor rehabilitation after stroke. The present article describes the study protocol for a randomized, controlled, examiner and patient blinded superiority trial (German Clinical Trials Register, www.drks.de, DRKS00011419), in which the method will be applied to 13 subacute stroke patients with hemiparesis during 12 sessions of 30 minutes each as additional feedback during the regular movement therapy. As primary outcome, a significant pre-post-change in the Box and Block Test is expected that exceeds the performance increase of 13 patients who will be provided with sham-acoustics. Possible limitations of the method as well as the study design are discussed.",

Little research has shown the use of interactive sonification in supporting motor therapeutic interventions for children with autism who exhibit motor impairments. The goal of this research is to study if children with autism understand the use of interactive sonification during motor therapeutic interventions, its potential impact of interactive sonification in the development of motor skills in children with autism, and the feasibility of using it in specialized schools for children with autism. We conducted two deployment studies in Mexico using Go-with-the-Flow, a framework to sonify movements previously developed for chronic pain rehabilitation. In the first study, six children with autism were asked to perform the forward reach and lateral upper-limb exercises while listening to three different sound structures (i.e., one discrete and two continuous sounds). Results showed that children with autism exhibit awareness about the sonification of their movements and engage with the sonification. We then adapted the sonifications based on the results of the first study, for motor therapy of children with autism. In the next study, nine children with autism were asked to perform upper-limb lateral, cross-lateral, and push movements while listening to five different sound structures (i.e., three discrete and two continues) designed to sonify the movements. Results showed that discrete sound structures engage the children in the performance of upper-limb movements and increase their ability to perform the movements correctly. We finally propose design considerations that could guide the design of projects related to interactive sonification",

Through a unique case study, we explore the ability of proofs of concept (POC) to contribute to the development of collective design capabilities to support this regime. This case study is based on a design project entitled \"rethinking medical emergency for elderly patients with loss of autonomy and patients with disability\". It was carried out by the Research Chair in Philosophy at the Hospital and the design agency les Sismo, and financially supported by the French National Solidarity Fund for Autonomy (CNSA). Our analytical framework describing design-oriented organisational capacities has the virtue of outlining the plurality of forms that these collective design capacities can take, and of the actors who express and develop them thanks to the POC in a training-action type modality. The POC should be used as a \"flash\" method to validate value hypotheses, but also to develop and explore the organisational conditions (knowledge, skills, legitimacy, ...) that are missing to continue the collective design process, and thus initiate the regeneration of the organisation. Our study also underlines the methodological limits of POC in this mission, notably that of restricting the exploration to a few design alternatives, and moreover alternatives for which the experimental fields are already known and easily accessible. To identify and control the risk of fuelling a regime of \"orphan innovation\", we recommend that POC managers produce a Concept-Knowledge (C-K) design framework.",

		"abstract": "<p>A popular goal in psychological science is to understand human cognition and behavior in the ‘real-world.’ In contrast, researchers have typically conducted their research in experimental research settings, a.k.a. the ‘psychologist’s laboratory.’ Critics have often questioned whether psychology’s laboratory experiments permit generalizable results. This is known as the ‘real-world or the lab’-dilemma. To bridge the gap between lab and life, many researchers have called for experiments with more ‘ecological validity’ to ensure that experiments more closely resemble and generalize to the ‘real-world.’ However, researchers seldom explain what they mean with this term, nor how more ecological validity should be achieved. In our opinion, the popular concept of ecological validity is ill-formed, lacks specificity, and falls short of addressing the problem of generalizability. To move beyond the ‘real-world or the lab’-dilemma, we believe that researchers in psychological science should always specify the particular context of cognitive and behavioral functioning in which they are interested, instead of advocating that experiments should be more ‘ecologically valid’ in order to generalize to the ‘real-world.’ We believe this will be a more constructive way to uncover the context-specific and context-generic principles of cognition and behavior.</p>",

Internal validity examines whether the study design, conduct, and analysis answer the research questions without bias. External validity examines whether the study findings can be generalized to other contexts. Ecological validity examines, specifically, whether the study findings can be generalized to real-life settings; thus ecological validity is a subtype of external validity. These concepts are explained using examples so that readers may understand why the consideration of internal, external, and ecological validity is important for designing and conducting studies, and for understanding the merits of published research.",

		"abstract": "Ecological validity is a relatively new concept in hearing science. It has been cited as relevant with increasing frequency in publications over the past 20 years, but without any formal conceptual basis or clear motive. The sixth Eriksholm Workshop was convened to develop a deeper understanding of the concept for the purpose of applying it in hearing research in a consistent and productive manner. Inspired by relevant debate within the field of psychology, and taking into account the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health framework, the attendees at the workshop reached a consensus on the following definition: “In hearing science, ecological validity refers to the degree to which research findings reflect real-life hearing-related function, activity, or participation.” Four broad purposes for striving for greater ecological validity in hearing research were determined: A (Understanding) better understanding the role of hearing in everyday life; B (Development) supporting the development of improved procedures and interventions; C (Assessment) facilitating improved methods for assessing and predicting ability to accomplish real-world tasks; and D (Integration and Individualization) enabling more integrated and individualized care. Discussions considered the effects of variables and phenomena commonly present in hearing-related research on the level of ecological validity of outcomes, supported by examples from a few selected outcome domains and for different types of studies. Illustrated with examples, potential strategies were offered for promoting a high level of ecological validity in a study and for how to evaluate the level of ecological validity of a study. Areas in particular that could benefit from more research to advance ecological validity in hearing science include: (1) understanding the processes of hearing and communication in everyday listening situations, and specifically the factors that make listening difficult in everyday situations; (2) developing new test paradigms that include more than one person (e.g., to encompass the interactive nature of everyday communication) and that are integrative of other factors that interact with hearing in real-life function; (3) integrating new and emerging technologies (e.g., virtual reality) with established test methods; and (4) identifying the key variables and phenomena affecting the level of ecological validity to develop verifiable ways to increase ecological validity and derive a set of benchmarks to strive for.",

		"abstract": "La recherche-action peut se définir comme une méthode de recherche dans laquelle « il y a une action délibérée de transformation de la réalité ; recherche[s] ayant un double objectif : transformer la réalité et produire des connaissances concernant ces transformations » (Hugon & Seibel, 1998 : 13 ). Cette définition générale se traduit par des formes très variées d’approches qui néanmoins se rejoignent au travers des traits caractéristiques communs :\nL’ensemble des méthodes de recherche-action revendique un double objectif de changement concret dans le système social et de production de connaissances sur celui-ci. Elles se démarquent ainsi des recherches conventionnelles (comme l’étude de cas par exemple) en posant le changement de l’objet investi comme objectif à part entière de la recherche. Suivant ainsi les principes de l’Action Research posés par Lewin (1946), on ne peut accéder à la connaissance d’un système social qu’en en faisant varier les dimensions constitutives et leurs relations, c’est-à-dire en induisant un changement de celui-ci. Ceci implique pour le chercheur d’intervenir délibérément sur la réalité étudiée, démarquant par là son rôle de celui de l’observateur neutre prescrit par les démarches scientifiques traditionnelles. Dans cette même perspective, parce que les connaissances élaborées doivent améliorer l’action et le management social (Lewin, 1946), les changements visés par la recherche-action doivent résoudre des problèmes concrets : « la recherche qui ne produit que des livres ne suffit pas » (Lewin, 1946, 1997  : 144). S’inscrivant dans des réalités sociales envisagées comme des systèmes complexes (multiplicité des rationalités et des représentations, interdépendance entre les dimensions à l’œuvre dans le système, caractère dynamique du système…), la recherche-action considère toujours les problèmes à résoudre comme des objets complexes. \nCes deux dimensions (intervention du chercheur sur des problèmes concrets complexes) amèneront, avec les travaux du Tavistock Institute (Jaques, 1951) et du Mouvement de la Démocratie Industrielle Norvégien (Emery & Thorsrud, 1976), à poser la participation des acteurs de terrain comme un principe fondamental de la recherche-action. \nLes trois dimensions clés de la recherche-action (changement, élaboration de connaissance et intervention) revêtent des significations différenciées en fonction des postulats épistémologiques et de la vision de la réalité sociale qu’ils portent. Ce chapitre se propose de présenter les approches de la recherche-action les plus utilisées en management en soulignant leurs spécificités en termes de visée et de processus de recherche. \nLes différents courants de la recherche-action peuvent ainsi être envisagés au travers de leur conception de l’articulation changement-connaissance. Nous distinguerons, dans la première partie de cet article, un ensemble de recherches qui posent le changement du système social comme un moyen d’élaboration de connaissances sur ce système, de celles qui se donnent pour objet premier la production d’un changement social. \nCes différentes visées sont portées par des conceptions de l’objet et des dispositifs de recherche différenciés comme nous le verrons dans la deuxième partie. Ces projets se rejoignent néanmoins dans la liberté qu’ils accordent au chercheur dans le choix des méthodes d’enquête et de changement, reflet de l’esprit du pragmatisme  toujours à l’œuvre dans la recherche-action. Les différentes étapes de conduite d’un projet de recherche-action (construction de l’objet de recherche, élaboration et mise en œuvre du design, choix des méthodes d’enquête et de changement) et les difficultés particulières émaillant ce processus, seront illustrées au travers d’une recherche menée dans une association du secteur médico-social du centre de la France.",

Déplaçant le locus d’innovation pour le mettre entre les mains des utilisateurs finaux, ces méthodes suscitent un intérêt grandissant dans le milieu de la santé, porté par la réduction des cycles de développement et des risques de développement, la meilleure appropriation par les usagers, une connexion plus riche avec ceux-ci et un enrichissement du processus d’innovation (Dubé et al., 2014). Qui plus est, ces approches ouvertes et inductives proposeraient une alternative à la médecine portée par les évidences (Evidence Based Medicine), dont certaines « lois » trouvent peu d’écho dans le quotidien des patients (Agogué, Comtet, Menudet, Picard, & Le Masson, 2013). Malgré leurs promesses, ces approches comportent de nombreux défis et limites : tensions entre les parties prenantes, paradoxes émanant de la démarche in media res (en train de se faire) (Leminen, DeFillippi, & Westerlund, 2015), motivation et engagement difficile à maintenir (Callari et al., 2019). Aussi, les méthodes par et pour doivent prendre en compte ces enjeux.",

		"abstract": "Blind individuals manifest remarkable abilities in navigating through space despite their lack of vision. They have previously been shown to perform normally or even supra-normally in tasks involving spatial hearing in near space, a region that, however, can be calibrated with sensory-motor feedback. Here we show that blind individuals not only properly map auditory space beyond their peri-personal environment but also demonstrate supra-normal performance when subtle acoustic cues for target location and distance must be used to carry out the task. Moreover, it is generally postulated that such abilities rest in part on cross-modal cortical reorganizations, particularly in the immature brain, where important synaptogenesis is still possible. Nonetheless, we show for the first time that even late-onset blind subjects develop above-normal spatial abilities, suggesting that significant compensation can occur in the adult.",

		"abstract": "Auditory distance perception is a crucial component of blind listeners' spatial awareness. Many studies have reported supra-normal spatial auditory abilities among blind individuals, such as enhanced azimuthal localization [Voss et al. (2004)] and distance discrimination [Kolarik et al. (in press)]. However, it is not known whether blind listeners are better able to use acoustic information to enhance judgments of distance to single sound sources, or whether lack of visual spatial cues prevents calibration of auditory distance information, leading to worse performance than for sighted listeners. Blind and sighted listeners were presented with single, stationary virtual sound sources between 1.22 and 13.79 m away in a virtual anechoic environment simulated using an image-source model. Stimuli were spoken sentences. Sighted listeners systematically underestimated distance to remote virtual sources, while blind listeners overestimated the distance to nearby virtual sources and underestimated it for remote virtual sources. The findings suggest that blind listeners are less accurate at judging absolute distance, and experience a compression of the auditory world, relative to sighted listeners. The results support a perceptual deficiency hypothesis for absolute distance judgments, suggesting that compensatory processes for audition do not develop among blind listeners when estimating the distance to single, stationary sound sources.",

		"abstract": "Blindness leads to substantial enhancements in many auditory abilities, and deficits in others. It is unknown how severe visual losses need to be before changes in auditory abilities occur, or whether the relationship between severity of visual loss and changes in auditory abilities is proportional and systematic. Here we show that greater severity of visual loss is associated with increased auditory judgments of distance and room size. On average participants with severe visual losses perceived sounds to be twice as far away, and rooms to be three times larger, than sighted controls. Distance estimates for sighted controls were most accurate for closer sounds and least accurate for farther sounds. As the severity of visual impairment increased, accuracy decreased for closer sounds and increased for farther sounds. However, it is for closer sounds that accurate judgments are needed to guide rapid motor responses to auditory events, e.g. planning a safe path through a busy street to avoid collisions with other people, and falls. Interestingly, greater visual impairment severity was associated with more accurate room size estimates. The results support a new hypothesis that crossmodal calibration of audition by vision depends on the severity of visual loss.",

We suggest that this is partially due to the egocentric frame of reference used by blind individuals. Here we investigate the possibility of reducing the mentioned auditory spatial impairments with an audio-motor training. Our hypothesis is that the association between a motor command and the corresponding movement's sensory feedback can provide an allocentric frame of reference and consequently help blind individuals in understanding complex spatial relationships. Subjects were required to localize the end point of a moving sound before and after either 2-min of audio-motor training or a complete rest. During the training, subjects were asked to move their hand, and consequently the sound source, to freely explore the space around the setup and the body. Both congenital blind (<italic>N</italic> = 20) and blindfolded healthy controls (<italic>N</italic> = 28) participated in the study. Results suggest that the audio-motor training was effective in improving space perception of blind individuals. The improvement was not observed in those subjects that did not perform the training. This study demonstrates that it is possible to recalibrate the auditory spatial representation in congenital blind individuals with a short audio-motor training and provides new insights for rehabilitation protocols in blind people.</p>",

		"abstract": "During the first years of life, sensory modalities communicate with each other. This process is fundamental for the development of unisensory and multisensory skills. The absence of one sensory input impacts on the development of other modalities. Since 2008 we have studied these aspects and developed our cross-sensory calibration theory. This theory emerged from the observation that children start to integrate multisensory information (such as vision and touch) only after 8–10 years of age. Before this age the more accurate sense teaches (calibrates) the others; when one calibrating modality is missing, the other modalities result impaired. Children with visual disability have problems in understanding the haptic or auditory perception of space and children with motor disabilities have problems in understanding the visual dimension of objects. This review presents our recent studies on multisensory integration and cross-sensory calibration in children and adults with and without sensory and motor disabilities. The goal of this review is to show the importance of interaction between sensory systems during the early period of life in order to correct perceptual development to occur.",

As one might expect, the performance of blind individuals in many behaviours and tasks requiring imagery can be inferior to that of sighted subjects; however, surprisingly often this is not the case. Interestingly, there is evidence that the blind often employ different cognitive mechanisms than sighted subjects, suggesting that compensatory mechanisms can overcome the limitations of sight loss. Taken together, these studies suggest that the nature of perceptual input on which we commonly rely strongly affects the organization of our mental processes. We also review recent neuroimaging studies on the neural correlates of sensory perception and mental imagery in visually impaired individuals that have cast light on the plastic functional reorganization mechanisms associated with visual deprivation.",

Recently, an early (50–90 ms) ERP response, selective for sound position in space, has been observed in the visual cortex of sighted individuals during the spatial but not the temporal bisection task. Here, we clarify the role of vision on spatial bisection abilities and neural correlates by studying late blind individuals. Results highlight that a shorter period of blindness is linked to a stronger contralateral activation in the visual cortex and a better performance during the spatial bisection task. Contrarily, not lateralized visual activation and lower performance are observed in individuals with a longer period of blindness. To conclude, the amount of time spent without vision may gradually impact on neural circuits underlying the construction of spatial representations in late blind participants. These findings suggest a key relationship between visual deprivation and auditory spatial abilities in humans.",

Enhanced auditory spatial skills in individuals with visual impairment have been reported by multiple studies, while some aspects of spatial hearing seem to be impaired in the absence of vision. In this study, the ability to encode the trajectory of a 2-dimensional sound motion, reproducing the complete movement, and reaching the correct end-point sound position, is evaluated in 12 early blind (EB) individuals, 8 late blind (LB) individuals, and 20 age-matched sighted blindfolded controls. EB individuals correctly determine the direction of the sound motion on the horizontal axis, but show a clear deficit in encoding the sound motion in the lower side of the plane. On the contrary, LB individuals and blindfolded controls perform much better with no deficit in the lower side of the plane. In fact the mean localization error resulted 271 ± 10 mm for EB individuals, 65 ± 4 mm for LB individuals, and 68 ± 2 mm for sighted blindfolded controls. These results support the hypothesis that (i) it exists a trade-off between the development of enhanced perceptual abilities and role of vision in the sound localization abilities of EB individuals, and (ii) the visual information is fundamental in calibrating some aspects of the representation of auditory space in the brain.</p>",

		"abstract": "Blind individuals do not necessarily receive more auditory stimulation than sighted individuals. However, to interact effectively with their environment, they have to rely on non-visual cues (in particular auditory) to a greater extent. Often benefiting from cerebral reorganization, they not only learn to rely more on such cues but also may process them better and, as a result, demonstrate exceptional abilities in auditory spatial tasks. Here we examine the effects of blindness on brain activity, using positron emission tomography (PET), during a sound-source discrimination task (SSDT) in both early- and late-onset blind individuals. This should not only provide an answer to the question of whether the blind manifest changes in brain activity but also allow a direct comparison of the two subgroups performing an auditory spatial task. The task was presented under two listening conditions: one binaural and one monaural. The binaural task did not show any significant behavioural differences between groups, but it demonstrated striate and extrastriate activation in the early-blind groups. A subgroup of early-blind individuals, on the other hand, performed significantly better than all the other groups during the monaural task, and these enhanced skills were correlated with elevated activity within the left dorsal extrastriate cortex. Surprisingly, activation of the right ventral visual pathway, which was significantly activated in the late-blind individuals during the monaural task, was negatively correlated with performance. This suggests the possibility that not all cross-modal plasticity is beneficial. Overall, our results not only support previous findings showing that occipital cortex of early-blind individuals is functionally engaged in spatial auditory processing but also shed light on the impact the age of onset of blindness can have on the ensuing cross-modal plasticity.",

Given that spectral cues are important for monaurally localizing sounds when one ear is obstructed, and that blind individuals are more sensitive to small spectral differences, we hypothesized that enhanced use of spectral cues via occipital cortex mechanisms could explain the better performance of blind individuals in monaural localization. Using positron-emission tomography (PET), we scanned blind and sighted persons as they discriminated between sounds originating from a single spatial position, but with different spectral profiles that simulated different spatial positions based on head-related transfer functions. We show here that a sub-group of early blind individuals showing superior monaural sound localization abilities performed significantly better than any other group on this spectral discrimination task. For all groups, performance was best for stimuli simulating peripheral positions, consistent with the notion that spectral cues are more helpful for discriminating peripheral sources. PET results showed that all blind groups showed cerebral blood flow increases in the occipital cortex; but this was also the case in the sighted group. A voxel-wise covariation analysis showed that more occipital recruitment was associated with better performance across all blind subjects but not the sighted. An inter-regional covariation analysis showed that the occipital activity in the blind covaried with that of several frontal and parietal regions known for their role in auditory spatial processing. Overall, these results support the notion that the superior ability of a sub-group of early-blind individuals to localize sounds is mediated by their superior ability to use spectral cues, and that this ability is subserved by cortical processing in the occipital cortex.</p>",

		"abstract": "PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of visual impairment on postural sway among older adults with open-angle glaucoma.\nMETHODS: This study included 54 community-dwelling participants with open-angle glaucoma, aged 65 and older. Binocular visual field loss was estimated from merged monocular Humphrey Field Analyzer visual field results and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness was obtained from the Stratus Optical Coherence Tomographer. Postural sway was measured under four conditions: eyes open and closed, on a firm, and a foam surface. Data were collected for additional vision measures (visual acuity and contrast sensitivity), physical performance measures (self-reported physical activity levels and 6-min walk test), and demographic measures (age, gender, body mass index, and medical history). Multivariate linear regressions, adjusting for confounding factors, were performed to determine the association between visual loss and postural sway.\nRESULTS: Participants with greater binocular visual field loss or thinner RNFL thickness showed increased postural sway, both on firm and foam surfaces, independent of age, gender, body mass index, and physical performance levels. These visual loss measures were significant predictors of postural sway, explaining almost 20% of its variance on the foam surface. Furthermore, participants with greater inferior hemifield visual field loss showed increased postural sway on the foam surface. Increasing glaucomatous visual impairment was accompanied by a steady decrease of the visual contribution to postural control.\nCONCLUSION: Among older adults with glaucoma, greater visual field loss or thinner RNFL thickness is associated with reduced postural stability. This postural instability may be a contributing factor in the increased risk of falls among older adults with glaucoma.",

		"abstract": "PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of long-term, not experimentally induced visual impairment on balance, and to clarify which means are used to compensate for this sensory deficit.\nMETHODS: Posturography was examined in 50 visually impaired subjects (11 with congenital blindness and 39 with acquired visual impairment) and 50 healthy controls. Examination was performed in 4 testing conditions: while standing on firm surface or foam pads (which decreases the somatosensory input) and with open or closed eyes (manipulating visual input).\nRESULTS: Subjects with acquired visual impairment were significantly less stable than controls when tested with open eyes, especially when standing on foam pads, but equal to controls when eyes were closed. Congenitally blind subjects performed equally to normal controls in all test conditions when tested with eyes open, and performed significantly better than controls with eyes closed. In comparison to subjects with acquired visual impairment, the congenitally blind were significantly more stable in all test conditions. Fourier analysis revealed that the visually impaired subjects showed decreased intensity values within the lowest frequency range of 0.1 Hz and below, a range believed to be sensitive to the function of the visual system.\nCONCLUSIONS: We have found that vision impairment influenced postural control, especially if acquired and not congenital. The somatosensory and vestibular systems serve as compensatory mechanisms, which is utilized most effectively by the congenitally blind.",

		"abstract": "PURPOSE: To assess the postural stability and gait characteristics of adults with age-related maculopathy (ARM) and to identify the visual factors associated with postural stability and gait in this clinical population.\nMETHODS: Participants included 80 individuals with a range of severity of ARM (mean age, 77.2 years). Binocular visual function measures included visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and merged binocular visual fields. Postural stability was assessed on both a firm and a foam surface using center-of-pressure measures derived from a force platform. Forty three of the participants underwent a three-dimensional motion analysis to quantify gait characteristics, including walking velocity, proportion of time spent with both feet in contact with the ground (double-support time), stride length, and step width.\nRESULTS: After adjustment for age, sex, self-reported physical function, and cataract severity, all the vision measures were significantly associated with postural stability on the foam surface, with contrast sensitivity being the strongest correlate. In the analysis of the gait measures, only contrast sensitivity was significantly associated with walking velocity, step width, or stride length, whereas contrast sensitivity and visual field loss were both significantly associated with double-support time.\nCONCLUSIONS: Impaired contrast sensitivity was associated with postural instability, slower walking velocity, increased step width, and reduced stride length. Impairments in either contrast sensitivity or visual fields were associated with increased double-support time. This result suggests that loss of contrast sensitivity and visual fields in patients with ARM can lead to balance and mobility problems.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The visual system enables the brain to assess information regarding the position of the body in space. Congenital or acquired blindness leads to the development of abnormal sensory-motor interactions that results in development of typical musculoskeletal deformities and gait patterns that cause disability. Diabetes and related complications are expected to increase exponentially in the next 10 years; thus, the number of people with visual impairment is expected to increase. However, there have been few studies regarding etio-pathogenesis of postural alteration and balance impairment in people with visual impairment; moreover, no previous study has investigated postural stability in this population. This study aimed to assess the center of gravity (COG) velocity in subjects with visual impairment and compared with that in sighted subjects.\nMETHODS: Seventy male subjects, 20-40 years of age, participated in this study; they were divided into sighted (control) and visually impaired groups. COG velocity while standing on an unstable surface was measured using the NeuroCom® Balance Master Version 8.5.0. For the sighted group, data were recorded with eyes open and then with eyes closed. For the visually impaired group, no instructions were given with respect to eyes during data collection.\nRESULTS: Mean COG velocity was significantly higher in the visually impaired group than in the sighted group with eyes open. However, there was no difference in mean COG velocity between the visually impaired group and the sighted group with eyes closed. The difference in mean COG velocity between sighted subjects with eyes open and eyes closed was also significant. Mean COG velocity while standing on a foam surface varied among visually impaired subjects and sighted subjects with eyes open and closed.\nCONCLUSION: This study showed that subjects with visual impairment, regardless of eye opening or closure, behave in the same manner as sighted subjects with eyes closed.",

The Brazilian version of Berg Balance Scale and the motor domain of functional independence measure were utilized. Results: On Berg Balance Scale the mean for acquired blindness was 54.0 ± 2.4 and 54.4 ± 2.5 for congenitally blind subjects; on functional independence measure the mean for acquired blind group was 87.1 ± 4.8 and 87.3 ± 2.3 for congenitally blind group. Conclusion: Based upon the scale used the results suggest the ability to control posture can be developed by compensatory mechanisms and it is not affected by visual loss in congenitally and acquired blindness.",

		"abstract": "Physician and physical therapist are daily challenged by a patient with balance disorder. Understanding the resources of the central nervous system allows (CNS) makes it possible to implement measures to prevent falls and their recurrence. Even when they are external environmental factors, often incriminated and which should be eliminated as much as possible, they usually display frailty of the balance. The CNS has to direct head and trunk according to the gravity, stabilize the body, anticipate imbalance, control the risks by reference to previous experiences, using automatized programs modulated or not, and adaptating to the environment. Each individual has his or her own sensori-motor patterns called ‘‘perceptualmotor style’’ which has to be recognized. Falls are often due to an inappropriate reaction or due to a risk-taking behavior not adapted to the skills of the subject. This dimension of risk-taking is major, allowed by cognitive resources. The elderly slowly complicates balance control by the alteration of sensors and effectors and by the slowing of information processing. But despite many causes of balance disorders according to neurologic lesions, CNS keeps for a long time outstanding possibilities of adaptation. General rules for balance rehabilitation are suggested here, as a basis for every rehabilitation program, in addition to speciﬁc measures when needed by deﬁciencies.",

Przeprowadzono analizę literatury przedmiotu.\nPROCES WYWODU: Omówiono główne konsekwencje utraty wzroku w dorosłości. Opisano proces tworzenia nowej reprezentacji własnego ciała w odwołaniu do stadialnej koncepcji przystosowania do utraty wzroku.\nWYNIKI ANALIZY NAUKOWEJ: Osoby ociemniałe, porównując aktualny wygląd i funkcjonalną sprawność z sytuacją przed utratą wzroku, odczuwają obcość swojego ciała. Utracie podstawowej funkcji poznawania rzeczywistości towarzyszy rozpad obrazu Ja fizycznego, brak zaufania do informacji płynących z pozostałych zmysłów oraz odczucie cielesnej niepełnowartościowości. Negatywny stosunek do własnej cielesności może być wzmacniany przez reakcje innych osób.\nWNIOSKI, INNOWACJE, REKOMENDACJE: Przekonania i emocje związane z własnym ciałem wpływają na dynamikę przystosowania, w tym motywację osoby ociemniałej do aktywnego udziału w rehabilitacji. Rehabilitacja psychologiczna powinna wspomagać osobę tracącą wzrok w dekonstrukcji Ja cielesnego i rekonstrukcji nowego obrazu ciała. Problem zmiany obrazu ciała w sytuacji nagłej utraty wzroku w dorosłości jest słabo rozpoznany. Istnieje konieczność prowadzenia badań koncentrujących się na tym zagadnieniu.",

		"abstract": "<p>In the last years, the positive impact of sensorimotor rehabilitation training on spatial abilities has been taken into account, e.g., providing evidence that combined multimodal compared to unimodal feedback improves responsiveness to spatial stimuli. To date, it still remains unclear to which extent spatial learning is influenced by training conditions. Here we investigated the effects of active and passive audio-motor training on spatial perception in the auditory and proprioceptive domains on 36 healthy young adults. First, to investigate the role of voluntary movements on spatial perception, we compared the effects of active vs. passive multimodal training on auditory and proprioceptive spatial localization. Second, to investigate the effectiveness of unimodal training conditions on spatial perception, we compared the impact of only proprioceptive or only auditory sensory feedback on spatial localization. Finally, to understand whether the positive effects of multimodal and unimodal trainings generalize to the untrained part, both dominant and non-dominant arms were tested. Results indicate that passive multimodal training (guided movement) is more beneficial than active multimodal training (active exploration) and only in passive condition the improvement is generalized also on the untrained hand. Moreover, we found that combined audio-motor training provides the strongest benefit because it significantly affects both auditory and somatosensory localization, while the effect of a single feedback modality is limited to a single domain, indicating a cross-modal influence of the two domains. Therefore, the use of multimodal feedback is more efficient in improving spatial perception. These results indicate that combined sensorimotor signals are effective in recalibrating auditory and proprioceptive spatial perception and that the beneficial effect is mainly due to the combination of auditory and proprioceptive spatial cues.</p>",

		"abstract": "Research in neuroscience reveals that the brain constructs multiple representation of space. Here, we primarily focus on peripersonal space (PPS) representation, the region of space immediately surrounding our bodies and in which objects can be grasped and manipulated. We review convergent results from several generations of studies, including neurophysiological studies in animals, neuropsychological investigations in monkeys and brain-damaged patients with spatial cognition disorders, as well as recent neuroimaging experiments in neurologically normal individuals. Collectively, these studies show that the primate brain constructs multiple, rapidly modifiable representations of space, centered on different body parts (i.e., hand-centered, head-centered, and trunk-centered), which arise through extensive multisensory interactions within a set of interconnected parietal and frontal regions. PPS representations are pivotal in the sensory guidance of motor behavior, allowing us to interact with objects and, as demonstrated by recent studies, with other people in the space around us.",

		"abstract": "Our daily-life actions are typically driven by vision. When acting upon an object, we need to represent its visual features (e.g. shape, orientation, etc.) and to map them into our own peripersonal space. But what happens with people who have never had any visual experience? How can they map object features into their own peripersonal space? Do they do it differently from sighted agents? To tackle these questions, we carried out a series of behavioral experiments in sighted and congenitally blind subjects. We took advantage of a spatial alignment effect paradigm, which typically refers to a decrease of reaction times when subjects perform an action (e.g., a reach-to-grasp pantomime) congruent with that afforded by a presented object. To systematically examine peripersonal space mapping, we presented visual or auditory affording objects both within and outside subjects' reach. The results showed that sighted and congenitally blind subjects did not differ in mapping objects into their own peripersonal space. Strikingly, this mapping occurred also when objects were presented outside subjects' reach, but within the peripersonal space of another agent. This suggests that (the lack of) visual experience does not significantly affect the development of both one's own and others' peripersonal space representation.",

		"abstract": "Multisensory peripersonal space develops in a maturational process that is thought to be influenced by early sensory experience. We investigated the role of vision in the effective development of audiotactile interactions in peripersonal space. Early blind (EB), late blind (LB) and sighted control (SC) participants were asked to lateralize auditory, tactile and audiotactile stimuli. The experiment was conducted with the hands uncrossed or crossed over the body midline in order to alter the relationship between personal and peripersonal spatial representations. First, we observed that the crossed posture results in a greater detrimental effect for tactile performance in sighted subjects but a greater deficit in auditory performance in early blind ones. This result is interpreted as evidence for a visually driven developmental process that automatically remaps tactile and proprioceptive spatial representation into an external framework. Second, we demonstrate that improved reaction times observed in the bimodal conditions in SC and LB exceeds that predicted by probability summation in both conditions of postures, indicating neural integration of different sensory information. In EB, nonlinear summation was obtained in the uncrossed but not in the crossed posture. We argue that the default use of an anatomically anchored reference system in EB prevents effective audiotactile interactions in the crossed posture due to the poorly aligned spatial coordinates of these two modalities in such conditions. Altogether, these results provide compelling evidence for the critical role of early vision in the development of multisensory perception and action control in peripersonal space.",

Interviews included a modified version of the National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire (Modified German NEI VFQ-25), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Mini-Mental State Examination Blind, and Indicators of the Rehabilitation Status. These were conducted before and 5 months after low-vision rehabilitation that involved recommendation of devices and instructing patients on how to use them. Of a total of 88 patients interviewed before low-vision rehabilitation, 50 patients could be reached for the follow-up interview. A huge proportion of the sample reported clinically significant depression (30%) or anxiety (30%). There were no differences between participants or dropouts. After fitting of low-vision devices, patients reported a significant improvement in perceived near tasks (P<0.01), social functioning (P<0.01), and reading ability (P<0.001). The magnitude of change was moderate. No significant changes were found in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Mini-Mental State Examination Blind, and Indicators of the Rehabilitation Status. Low-vision rehabilitation appears to have a broader effect than simply improving visual performance, as it may positively influence social functioning. Even though this study had no control group, the influence of low-vision aids on social functioning has not been reported before and should encourage their use.",

The mean age of the patients was 38.5 (SD 13.3) years, and 42% of the subjects were women. They answered the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ) to assess the vision-related quality of life and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) to assess depressive symptoms. Patients were classified into groups with and without depression according to the BDI score. The NEI-VFQ composite and subscale scores were compared between groups. The correlations between the BDI and the NEI-VFQ, weighted visual acuity (WVA) and functional vision score (FVS) were investigated.\nRESULTS: The depressed group had significantly less subjective visual function compared with the non-depressed group. A negative correlation was observed between the BDI and the NEI-VFQ scores, while no correlation was found between the BDI score and WVA or FVS.\nCONCLUSION: The RP patients with depression had poorer vision-related functions compared with those patients without depression, which cannot be explained by the visual acuity. Interventions to diagnose and treat depression are necessary to enhance the overall quality of life in RP patients.",

		"abstract": "PURPOSE: To determine the relationship between glaucoma severity and rate of falls, fear of falling, and avoidance of activities at-risk for falls.\nDESIGN: Cross-sectional study.\nMETHODS: Patients with glaucoma (n = 138) 55 to 90 years of age with mild (n = 61), moderate (n = 54), or advanced (n = 23) glaucoma in the better eye based on the Glaucoma Staging System and age-matched control subjects (n = 50) were recruited from the Eye Clinics at Washington University, St. Louis, MO. Participants completed questionnaires regarding falls, the fear of falling, and the avoidance of activities at-risk for falls.\nRESULTS: Of the glaucoma participants, 36% reported ≥1 fall in the previous 12 months compared with 20% of control subjects (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.7 [95% confidence interval {CI} 1.18-6.17]; P = .018). Compared with control subjects, the mild glaucoma group trended toward a higher fall risk (adjusted OR 2.43 [95% CI 0.97-6.08]; P = .059) and the advanced group had the highest fall risk (adjusted OR 7.97 [95% CI 2.44-26.07]; P = .001). A greater risk of a high fear of falling and high avoidance of at-risk activities occurred at the moderate stage of glaucoma compared with control subjects (adjusted OR 4.66 [95% CI 1.24-17.49]; P = .023 and adjusted OR 4.49 [95% CI 1.34-15.05]; P = .015, respectively).\nCONCLUSIONS: Patient education, interventions, and appropriate referrals to minimize falls should be considered in older adults with early glaucoma and continue with advancing disease. Minimizing a patient's fall risk may decrease their fear of falling and avoidance of at-risk activities. Reducing falls, the fear of falling, and the avoidance of at-risk activities may lower morbidity and mortality and improve emotional and social well-being of patients with glaucoma.

The present population-based cross-sectional study was conducted on people aged 60 and older in Tehran, Iran using multi-stage cluster sampling. After selecting the samples, examinations including visual acuity measurement, refraction, and slit-lamp biomicroscopy were performed for all participants. The GHQ was used to examine mental disorders. Simple and multiple linear regressions were used to investigate the association between VI and mental disorders. Of the 3740 invitees, 3310 participated in the study (response rate: 88.50%). After applying the exclusion criteria, 2789 individuals were analyzed for this report. Mean score of physical, anxiety, social and depression disorders in people with and without VI was 3.74 ± 2.03, 5.81 ± 2.79, 7.56 ± 1.91, 1.32 ± 1.90, and 3.14 ± 1.76, 4.93 ± 2.71, 8.09 ± 1.99, 0.91 ± 1.38, respectively. The total score of GHQ in participants with and without VI was 18.43 ± 4.75 and 17.07 ± 4.19, respectively. The association between GHQ subscales and total GHQ score with VI by multiple linear regression showed that VI had a statistically significant direct association with physical symptoms (β = 0.37; 95% CI 0.12 to 0.62) and anxiety (β = 0.48; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.81). Nevertheless, depression had a borderline association with VI (β = 0.21; 95% CI − 0.03 to 0.45) and social dysfunction did not have a statistically significant association with VI in the final linear regression model and did not remain in the model. Total GHQ score had a statistically significant association with VI (β = 1.02; 95% CI 0.39 to 1.64) in the presence of covariates. Regarding the association between VI and GHQ components, the physical symptoms had the highest R2 (R2 = 0.159). Patients with VI suffer more from anxiety, depression, and physical symptoms regardless of age, sex, education, and other effective variables. The coincidence of aging with VI and the association of VI with mental disorders emphasizes the importance of a broader view of the elderly and the aging process.",

		"abstract": "PURPOSE: To determine if glaucomatous visual field defect severity is associated with fear of falling.\nMETHODS: This is a cross-sectional study. A total of 387 consecutive subjects with POAG were enrolled in this study along with 293-ocular disease-free control subjects, who were screened at the same institutions. We defined mild POAG as MD of -6 dB or better, moderate POAG as MD of -6 to -12 dB, and severe POAG as MD of -12 dB or worse in the better eye. All participants were requested to answer a questionnaire on fear of falling. Associations between POAG severity and the prevalence of fear of falling were evaluated with the Cochran-Armitage trend test. Multivariable factors including age-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for the prevalence of fear of falling and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were evaluated with logistic regression models.\nRESULTS: The prevalence of fear of falling was 35/293 (11.9%) in the control group, 38/313 (12.1%) in the mild POAG group, 12/48 (25.0%) in the moderate POAG group, and 6/26 (23.1%) in the severe POAG group, and the trend was statistically significant (P = 0.028 Cochran-Armitage trend test). The adjusted ORs for prevalence in the mild, moderate, and severe POAG groups compared with that in the control group were 1.44 (95% CI: 0.83-2.51), 2.33 (95% CI: 1.00-5.44), and 4.06 (95% CI: 1.39-11.90), respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among patients with POAG, the severity of visual field defects is associated with fear of falling.

		"abstract": "Background Movement sonification, the use of real‑time auditory feedback linked to movement parameters, have been proposed to support rehabilitation. Nevertheless, if promising results have been reported, the effect of the type of sound used has not been studied systematically. The aim of this study was to investigate in a single session the effect of different types of sonification both quantitatively and qualitatively on patients with acquired brain lesions and healthy participants.\nMethods An experimental setup enabling arm sonification was developed using three different categories of soni‑fication (direct sound modulation, musical interaction, and soundscape). Simple moving forward movements performed while sliding on a table with both arms were investigated with all participants. Quantitative analysis on the movement timing were performed considering various parameters (sound condition, affected arm and domi‑nance, sonification categories). Qualitative analysis of semi‑structured interviews were also conducted, as well as neu‑ropsychological evaluation of music perception.\nResults For both the patient and healthy groups (15 participants each), average duration for performing the arm movement is significantly longer with sonification compared to the no‑sound condition (p < 0.001). Qualitative analysis of semi‑structured interviews revealed different aspects of motivational and affective aspects of sonification. Most participants of both groups preferred to complete the task with sound (29 of 30 participants), and described the experience as playful (22 of 30 participants). More precisely, the soundscape (nature sounds) was the most con‑stantly preferred (selected first by 14 of 30 participants).\nConclusion Overall, our results confirm that the sonification has an effect on the temporal execution of the move‑ment during a single‑session. Globally, sonification is welcomed by the participants, and we found convergent and differentiated appreciations of the different sonification types.",

		"abstract": "The phenomenology of the blind has provided an age-old, unparalleled means of exploring the enigmatic link between the brain and mind. This paper delves into the unique phenomenological experience of a man who became blind in adulthood. He subsequently underwent both an Argus II retinal prosthesis implant and training, and extensive training on the EyeMusic visual to auditory sensory substitution device (SSD), thereby becoming the first reported case to date of dual proficiency with both devices. He offers a firsthand account into what he considers the great potential of combining sensory substitution devices with visual prostheses as part of a complete visual restoration protocol. While the Argus II retinal prosthesis alone provided him with immediate visual percepts by way of electrically stimulated phosphenes elicited by the device, the EyeMusic SSD requires extensive training from the onset. Yet following the extensive training program with the EyeMusic sensory substitution device, our subject reports that the sensory substitution device allowed him to experience a richer, more complex perceptual experience, that felt more \"second nature\" to him, while the Argus II prosthesis (which also requires training) did not allow him to achieve the same levels of automaticity and transparency. Following long-term use of the EyeMusic SSD, our subject reported that visual percepts representing mainly, but not limited to, colors portrayed by the EyeMusic SSD are elicited in association with auditory stimuli, indicating the acquisition of a high level of automaticity. Finally, the case study indicates an additive benefit to the combination of both devices on the user's subjective phenomenological visual experience.",

The effects of music are greatly variable from one individual to the other and do not always reach the expected benefits. This study aimed to optimize the use of music in the management of movement disorders inherent to PD in a handwriting task. We developed and tested musical sonification (MS), a method that transforms in real-time kinematic variables into music. Twelve patients with PD, on medication, and 12 healthy controls were recruited in a pretest/training/posttest design experiment. Three training sessions were compared, for which participants were asked to produce graphomotor exercises: one session with music (unrelated to handwriting), one with MS (controlled by handwriting), and one in silence. Results showed that the performance in training was better under MS than under silence or background music, for both groups. After training, the benefits of MS were still present for both groups, with a higher effect for PD patients than for control group. Our results provide a proof of concept to consider MS as a relevant auditory guidance strategy for movement rehabilitation in patients with PD.",

		"abstract": "The effects of music on bodily movement and feelings, such as when people are dancing or engaged in physical activity, are well-documented—people may move in response to the sound cues, feel powerful, less tired. How sounds and bodily movements relate to create such effects? Here we deconstruct the problem and investigate how different auditory features affect people’s body-representation and feelings even when paired with the same movement. In three experiments, participants executed a simple arm raise synchronised with changing pitch in simple tones (Experiment 1), rich musical sounds (Experiment 2) and within different frequency ranges (Experiment 3), while we recorded indirect and direct measures on their movement, body-representations and feelings. Changes in pitch influenced people’s general emotional state as well as the various bodily dimensions investigated—movement, proprioceptive awareness and feelings about one’s body and movement. Adding harmonic content amplified the differences between ascending and descending sounds, while shifting the absolute frequency range had a general effect on movement amplitude, bodily feelings and emotional state. These results provide new insights in the role of auditory and musical features in dance and exercise, and have implications for the design of sound-based applications supporting movement expression, physical activity, or rehabilitation.",

		"abstract": "Chronic (persistent) pain (CP) affects 1 in 10 adults; clinical resources are insufficient, and anxiety about activity restricts lives. Technological aids monitor activity but lack necessary psychological support. This article proposes a new sonification framework, Go-with-the-Flow, informed by physiotherapists and people with CP. The framework proposes articulation of user-defined sonified exercise spaces (SESs) tailored to psychological needs and physical capabilities that enhance body and movement awareness to rebuild confidence in physical activity. A smartphone-based wearable device and a Kinect-based device were designed based on the framework to track movement and breathing and sonify them during physical activity. In control studies conducted to evaluate the sonification strategies, people with CP reported increased performance, motivation, awareness of movement, and relaxation with sound feedback. Home studies, a focus group, and a survey of CP patients conducted at the end of a hospital pain management session provided an in-depth understanding of how different aspects of the SESs and their calibration can facilitate self-directed rehabilitation and how the wearable version of the device can facilitate transfer of gains from exercise to feared or demanding activities in real life. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings on the design of technology for physical rehabilitation.",

		"abstract": "Background of the study: Vision plays a significant role in keeping a body's balance steady by consistently giving information about the environment, body movement and body position to the higher centers. Disruption can cause problems with Balance.\nMethodology: It was a cross-sectional study based on the convenience sampling method. 384 participants were recruited. Data was gathered from five different settings. All balance components were screened using various tests, i.e., Romberg's and a modified tandem walk, to screen for proprioception and vestibular abnormalities.\nResults: Of 384 participants, 66.9% in Group A had normal vision (6/6 – 6/9), and 33.1% in Group 2 had slightly impaired vision (6/12 – 6/18). The frequency table of BBS shows that 356(92.7%) participants had average Balance, and 28(7.3%) participants had impaired balance. Cross-tabulation of the Snellen group with BBS shows that 257 participants of Group 1 had normal vision and Balance, and no one had impaired Balance. One hundred twenty-seven participants of Group 2 had slightly impaired vision; among them, 99 participants had average Balance, and 28 participants had impaired Balance with a p-value of 0.000 found to be significant.\nConclusion: This study concludes Participants with visual impairments had the most negligible impact on the balance system, whereas those with normal vision exhibited no impact.",

		"abstract": "Concurrent augmented feedback has been shown to be less effective for learning simple motor tasks than for complex tasks. However, as mostly artificial tasks have been investigated, transfer of results to tasks in sports and rehabilitation remains unknown. Therefore, in this study, the effect of different concurrent feedback was evaluated in trunk-arm rowing. It was then investigated whether multimodal audiovisual and visuohaptic feedback are more effective for learning than visual feedback only. Naïve subjects (N = 24) trained in three groups on a highly realistic virtual reality-based rowing simulator. In the visual feedback group, the subject's oar was superimposed to the target oar, which continuously became more transparent when the deviation between the oars decreased. Moreover, a trace of the subject's trajectory emerged if deviations exceeded a threshold. The audiovisual feedback group trained with oar movement sonification in addition to visual feedback to facilitate learning of the velocity profile. In the visuohaptic group, the oar movement was inhibited by path deviation-dependent braking forces to enhance learning of spatial aspects. All groups significantly decreased the spatial error (tendency in visual group) and velocity error from baseline to the retention tests. Audiovisual feedback fostered learning of the velocity profile significantly more than visuohaptic feedback. The study revealed that well-designed concurrent feedback fosters complex task learning, especially if the advantages of different modalities are exploited. Further studies should analyze the impact of within-feedback design parameters and the transferability of the results to other tasks in sports and rehabilitation.",

Technology probes are simple, flexible, adaptable technologies with three interdisciplinary goals: the social science goal of understanding the needs and desires of users in a real-world setting, the engineering goal of field-testing the technology, and the design goal of inspiring users and researchers to think about new technologies. We present the results of designing and deploying two technology probes, the messageProbe and the videoProbe, with diverse families in France, Sweden, and the U.S. We conclude with our plans for creating new technologies for and with families based on our experiences.",
