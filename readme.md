# How to use ?

This project is meant as a ready-to-go file management system for litterature reviews. 

You only need to put the .json file for your zotero library in the data folder, and run the python script; 
Each item will generate a unique .md file, and an aggreagated version of all the info will be created as a .csv file.
Then each time you update the json file and rerun the script, added articles will generate new review .md files.
